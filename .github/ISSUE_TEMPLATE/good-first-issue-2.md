### 🧠 Your Task:
1. Clone this repo and install the app (see [app/README.md](../blob/main/app/README.md))
2. Run the app and go to the “New Entry” tab
3. Input:
    - Your prompt
    - A model name (e.g. GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini Pro)
    - A valid AI-generated response
    - Optional tags
4. The app will save the following folder under `prompts/`:
```
prompts/YYYY-MM-DD_my_slug/
├── prompt.md
├── MODEL.md
└── metadata.json
```
5. Commit that folder and submit a Pull Request.

### ✅ Example PR Title:
**`Add: prompt about 'ethical decision making' with GPT-4 response`**

🛠 No code needed. Just a clean prompt, a relevant model output, and your curiosity.
