**Transformative AI in Pedagogy: Fostering Co-creative Learning, Metacognitive
Skills, and AI-Generated Immersive Educational Realities**

- **Focus Area:** AI in Education, Learning Sciences, Human-AI Collaboration, Immersive Technologies
- **Prompt Details:** "Conduct a comprehensive research exploration into how AI can fundamentally reshape pedagogical methods beyond personalized content delivery, focusing on its role in fostering co-creative learning partnerships, developing students' metacognitive skills, and enabling the generation of dynamic, immersive educational realities. This research should investigate:
  - **AI as a Co-creative and Socratic Partner:** Design and evaluate AI systems that act as collaborative learning partners for students â€“ engaging in Socratic dialogue, co-constructing knowledge, facilitating brainstorming, providing constructive critiques on complex projects, and scaffolding research skills.
  - **AI for Developing Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning:** Explore how AI tools can help students become more aware of their own learning processes, identify knowledge gaps, set effective learning goals, select appropriate strategies, monitor their understanding, and reflect on their learning experiences.
  - **AI-Generated Adaptive and Interactive Educational Realities:** Investigate the use of generative AI (including LLMs, image/video synthesis, and procedural content generation) to create rich, interactive, and adaptive simulations, virtual worlds, and scenario-based learning environments that respond dynamically to student inquiries and actions, allowing for exploration of complex systems and ethical dilemmas.
  - **Assessing Higher-Order Thinking in AI-Augmented Learning Environments:** Develop novel assessment methodologies to evaluate critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and collaborative skills in educational settings where students extensively leverage AI tools.
  - **Ethical Implications of Deep AI Integration in Learning:** Analyze the ethical considerations of AI's influence on student autonomy, creativity, critical thinking, the student-teacher relationship, data privacy, and the potential for AI-induced biases in educational content or feedback.
  - **Teacher Education and New Pedagogical Roles in an AI-Rich Future:** What new skills and pedagogical approaches will educators need to effectively integrate and orchestrate these advanced AI tools in the classroom? How can AI itself support teacher professional development?"
- **Keywords for further research:** AI pedagogy, co-creative AI learning, AI metacognition, immersive learning AI, generative AI education, AI Socratic tutor, future of education AI, AI educational simulations.
