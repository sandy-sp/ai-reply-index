Introduction: The Intertwined Destinies of Brain and Machine\n\n### 1.1. A Historical Perspective on the Symbiotic Relationship\n\nThe convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and neuroscience marks a\ntransformative era, fundamentally redefining our understanding of the brain\nand unlocking new possibilities in research, diagnosis, and therapy.1 This\nburgeoning interdisciplinary domain, often referred to as NeuroAI, seeks to\nbridge the chasm between artificial and natural intelligence by leveraging\nprofound insights from brain function to develop more robust, efficient, and\ninterpretable AI models.2\n\nThe human brain, a marvel of biological engineering, comprises approximately\n86 billion neurons interconnected by trillions of synaptic connections,\noperating as a highly dynamic, non-linear system.1 Deciphering its intricate\nfunctions\u2014ranging from fundamental reflexes to complex higher-order\ncognition\u2014necessitates the processing of immense volumes of diverse data,\nspanning modalities such as neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and behavioral\nstudies.1 Historically, traditional analytical tools, while effective within\nlimited scopes, frequently proved insufficient in capturing the nuanced,\nmulti-scale patterns embedded within this vast neural data. This critical\nanalytical gap directly propelled the integration of AI as an indispensable\ntool for neuroscientific exploration.1 The inherent complexity and sheer\nvolume of neural data created a compelling need for advanced computational\nmethods, establishing a problem-solution dynamic where AI emerged as a\nnecessary advancement for neuroscientific progress.\n\nThe foundational methodologies of AI, including Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs) and machine learning, were significantly inspired by the brain's neural\nnetworks and hierarchical organization.1 Early computational frameworks\nmimicked biological principles such as Hebbian learning and synaptic\nplasticity, which are fundamental to biological intelligence.1 This initial\nconceptual borrowing laid the groundwork for a relationship that has since\nevolved into a profound and reciprocal \"symbiotic relationship\".4 This\nbidirectional feedback loop signifies that neuroscience not only benefits\nimmensely from AI's computational prowess but also continuously inspires AI's\nevolution.1 This indicates that the relationship has matured beyond\nsuperficial mimicry. Neuroscience now actively informs the development of\ndeeper, more sophisticated AI models by providing blueprints for how\nintelligence emerges in biological systems, thereby enabling the creation of\nAI systems that are not just powerful but also more human-like in their\nadaptive and learning capabilities.\n\n### 1.2. Core Motivations for Convergence and Mutual Benefits\n\nThe convergence of AI and neuroscience offers unparalleled opportunities to\ndeepen our understanding of the brain while simultaneously advancing practical\napplications in research and medicine.1 AI's inherent capacity to identify\nhidden patterns, model complex relationships, and make accurate predictions is\ncentral to its utility in this symbiotic partnership.1\n\nScientists are actively leveraging AI tools to efficiently process and\nsynthesize massive datasets, enabling them to pose increasingly complex\nquestions about natural intelligence.4 Concurrently, fundamental scientific\nconcepts derived from neuroscience are being utilized to construct more\ninterpretable and efficient AI systems for a diverse array of applications.4\nThis represents a synergistic value proposition, where the combined efforts of\nboth fields yield qualitative leaps in understanding and capability that\nneither could achieve in isolation. AI's proficiency in handling data at scale\nand its ability to manage complexity complement neuroscience's relentless\npursuit of fundamental principles, while neuroscience provides the essential\nblueprint for designing AI that is inherently smarter and more akin to human\ncognition.\n\nAI provides a substantial \"productivity boost\" by facilitating the processing\nof enormous data volumes, such as those generated by climate models or\nparticle colliders.4 This enhanced efficiency allows researchers to undertake\ncomputationally intensive theoretical calculations and make real-time\nprocessing decisions with unprecedented speed.4 The National Academies have\nformally recognized this as a \"symbiotic relationship,\" which is actively\ndriving research in critical areas such as behavior, vision, and language\ndevelopment.4\n\nA particularly transformative aspect of this convergence is the predictive\npower of AI in neuroscience research. Large Language Models (LLMs), for\ninstance, have demonstrated the ability to predict neuroscience study outcomes\nwith higher accuracy than human experts.7 This capability allows researchers\nto access and synthesize vast scientific literature that no human could\nassimilate in a lifetime.8 The implications of this development are strategic,\nsignaling a paradigm shift in scientific methodology. AI can now guide\nneuroscientists in optimizing limited resources like time and money, enabling\ntimely adjustments based on probable outcomes, and significantly augmenting\nour understanding of the brain and central nervous system.8 This indicates a\nprofound transformation in the scientific process itself, where AI functions\nas a powerful assistant for hypothesis generation and experimental design,\npotentially accelerating the pace of discovery and evolving the very nature of\nhuman scientific inquiry.\n\n## 2\\. Brain-Inspired Principles for Advanced AI Architectures\n\nThe human brain, with its unparalleled computational efficiency and adaptive\nlearning capabilities, serves as a profound source of inspiration for the\ndevelopment of advanced AI architectures. By abstracting and implementing\nprinciples observed in biological neural networks, researchers are designing\nAI systems that are not only more powerful but also more robust, energy-\nefficient, and capable of human-like cognition.\n\n### Table 1: Key Brain-Inspired AI Architectures and Their Biological\nAnalogies\n\n  \n\nAI Architecture/Concept| Biological Analogy/Inspiration| Key Benefit/Feature\nin AI| Relevant Sources  \n---|---|---|---  \nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs)| Neurons and Synapses| Pattern Recognition,\nLearning from Data| 1  \nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)| Visual Cortex (hierarchical processing)|\nImage Analysis, Feature Extraction| 1  \nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)| Temporal sequences in brain| Temporal\nSequence Interpretation| 1  \nReinforcement Learning (RL)| Trial-and-error learning, Dopamine system|\nAdaptive Learning, Decision-making| 5  \nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs)| Biological neurons (spikes, event-driven)|\nEnergy Efficiency, Real-time Processing| 2  \nNeuromorphic Computing| Brain's energy efficiency, parallelism| High Execution\nSpeed, Robustness| 1  \nHippocampus-Inspired Models| Episodic memory, Place cells| Spatial Awareness,\nNavigation, Episodic Memory, Predictive Analytics| 13  \nNeocortex-Inspired Models| Hierarchical processing, Compositionality| Problem\nDecomposition, Generalization, Data Efficiency| 15  \nCerebellum-Inspired Models| Motor coordination, Interpretable reasoning| Motor\nControl, Interpretable Planning, Accuracy| 17  \nNeuron-Astrocyte Networks| Astrocytes, Long-term memory| Robustness, Continual\nLearning, Memory Buffer| 1  \nSynaptic Plasticity in AI| Synaptic strengthening/weakening| Adaptability,\nMultitasking, Continual Learning| 1  \nNeural Oscillations in AI| Brain rhythms, Temporal dynamics| Stable\nPredictions, Long-range Dependencies| 28  \nCognitive Architectures| Human cognitive processes (perception, memory,\ndecision-making)| Human-like Learning, Problem Solving, Adaptability| 2  \n  \n### 2.1. Foundational Concepts: Artificial Neural Networks and Reinforcement\nLearning\n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) represent a cornerstone of AI, drawing\ndirect inspiration from the brain's fundamental neural networks.1 These\ncomputational models mimic the brain's hierarchical organization, where\ninformation is processed through interconnected layers of artificial neurons,\nenabling efficient information processing and pattern recognition.1 The\nlearning mechanisms within ANNs are often modeled on biological principles\nsuch as Hebbian learning, frequently summarized as \"neurons that fire\ntogether, wire together,\" and synaptic plasticity, which refers to the ability\nof connections between neurons to strengthen or weaken over time based on\nactivity.1\n\nA prominent type of ANN, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is specifically\ninspired by the brain's visual processing system. The human visual cortex\nprocesses visual information hierarchically, with different layers responding\nto increasingly complex features, from simple edges to intricate objects.1\nCNNs replicate this hierarchical architecture, making them exceptionally\neffective for analyzing neuroimaging data and performing advanced image\nrecognition tasks.1 Similarly, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed\nto model temporal sequences, drawing inspiration from the brain's remarkable\nability to interpret time-dependent signals, which is crucial for applications\nlike electrophysiological signal analysis.1\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are another area of AI profoundly\nshaped by insights into how the brain learns through interaction with its\nenvironment.5 Several parallels exist between RL and biological learning. Both\nRL agents and the human brain learn through trial and error, experimenting\nwith different actions to maximize cumulative rewards.5 This reward-based\nlearning in RL is directly inspired by the brain's dopamine system, which\nplays a central role in reward processing and reinforcing behaviors that lead\nto positive outcomes.5 Furthermore, both systems utilize \"value functions\" to\nestimate expected rewards for actions, a mechanism in the brain often\ninvolving the prefrontal cortex for decision-making.5 The inherent tension\nbetween \"exploration\" (trying new actions) and \"exploitation\" (using known\nactions that yield high rewards) is also a balance performed by both RL agents\nand the brain.5\n\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) extends these parallels by exploring\nhierarchical learning, mirroring how the brain processes sensory information\nin stages to extract increasingly complex features.5 A significant challenge\nin both DRL and the brain is the \"credit assignment problem\"\u2014determining which\nspecific actions are responsible for delayed rewards. While DRL addresses this\nusing methods like backpropagation through time and temporal difference\nlearning, the brain's reinforcement learning circuits, involving the\nprefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, help attribute credit for actions.5\n\nWhile ANNs and RL are founded on brain-inspired concepts, their initial\nimplementations often represented a simplified abstraction of biological\nprocesses. For instance, traditional ANNs rely on continuous activations,\ncontrasting with the discrete spikes of biological neurons.18 This highlights\na recognized gap between initial, abstract inspiration and the full complexity\nof biological systems. The ongoing pursuit of \"biologically plausible\" AI,\nexemplified by the development of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) 9, suggests\nthat a deeper fidelity to actual neural mechanisms is seen as a pathway to\nunlock further performance gains and address current AI limitations, such as\ncatastrophic forgetting, by moving beyond superficial borrowing to a more\nfaithful replication of neural dynamics.\n\n### 2.2. Neuromorphic Computing: Hardware Mimicking Biological Efficiency\n\nNeuromorphic computing represents a transformative advancement in AI hardware,\ndirectly implementing aspects of biological neural networks onto electronic\ncircuits.11 This approach aims to replicate the spiking behavior of biological\nneurons in hardware, moving beyond traditional von Neumann architectures that\nseparate processing and memory, which are energy-intensive and less efficient\nfor brain-like computations.1\n\nA primary advantage of neuromorphic computing over conventional approaches\nlies in its superior energy efficiency, high execution speed, inherent\nrobustness against local failures, and an advanced ability to learn.11 These\nsystems are designed for massive parallelism, mirroring the brain's\ndistributed processing capabilities. Prominent neuromorphic systems, such as\nSpiNNaker and BrainScaleS, exemplify these advantages. SpiNNaker, located in\nManchester, UK, connects one million ARM processors optimized for exchanging\nneural action potentials (spikes) and operates in real-time.11 BrainScaleS,\ndeveloped in Heidelberg, Germany, uses analog electronic models of neurons and\nsynapses, capable of emulating neurons at speeds ranging from 1,000 to 10,000\ntimes faster than biological real-time. This acceleration is particularly\nvaluable for investigating plasticity and learning mechanisms over timescales\nthat are prohibitive for conventional supercomputers.11\n\nNeuromorphic computing is positioned as a significant \"growth accelerator\" for\nAI, capable of boosting high-performance computing and serving as a\nfundamental building block for artificial superintelligence.12 The development\nof neuromorphic hardware is not merely an engineering feat but a critical\nenabler for brain-inspired AI paradigms like SNNs. This indicates a co-\nevolutionary path where hardware advancements facilitate more biologically\nfaithful AI models, which in turn drive demand for specialized, efficient\nhardware, creating a reinforcing cycle of innovation.\n\nThe implications of neuromorphic computing extend across various domains. Its\nenergy efficiency and real-time processing capabilities position it as a\npotential disruptor for \"edge AI\" applications. This allows complex AI\nprocessing to move from energy-intensive cloud data centers to local devices\nsuch as smartphones, wearables, and autonomous vehicles.11 This shift could\nprofoundly impact privacy, latency, and the scalability of AI deployment,\nenabling ubiquitous, always-on, and highly responsive AI capabilities directly\non end-user devices. Furthermore, large-scale neuromorphic systems can\nidentify causal relations in complex data from science, finance, and\ngovernment, and integrate into consumer products like driverless cars and\ndomestic robots in the long term.11\n\n### 2.3. Spiking Neural Networks: Towards Biological Realism and Temporal\nProcessing\n\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a significant advancement in\nartificial neural networks, specifically designed to closely mimic the\nbiological neural processes of the human brain.2 Unlike traditional ANNs that\nprocess information using continuous values, SNNs operate through dynamic,\ntime-dependent discrete signals known as \"spikes.\" Neurons in SNNs fire only\nwhen their input reaches a certain threshold, much like biological neurons\ngenerate action potentials.9 This event-driven nature makes SNNs uniquely\nefficient in terms of power and data processing, rendering them particularly\nbeneficial for low-power systems and specialized neuromorphic chips.5\n\nSNNs exhibit a remarkable ability to model the brain's natural temporal\ndynamics. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for tasks that demand\nprecise timing and quick adaptation, including real-time sensory processing,\nmotor control, and rapid decision-making.9 Their proficiency in handling\nspatiotemporal data has led to notable advancements, such as the development\nof neuromorphic vision sensors that mimic the human retina, enabling more\nenergy-efficient real-time image processing than conventional systems.9\n\nDespite their compelling advantages in biological plausibility and efficiency,\nSNNs face several challenges. A notable limitation is the current absence of a\ncomplete theoretical framework and well-established training methods, which\ncan hinder their widespread adoption.9 In some applications, their performance\nmay still lag behind conventional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).10 This\nhighlights a critical trade-off that researchers are actively working to\nresolve: balancing the inherent efficiency and biological fidelity of SNNs\nwith the raw performance capabilities of highly optimized, but less\nbiologically realistic, DNNs. To overcome these training difficulties, new\ntechniques such as Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and surrogate\ngradient methods are emerging. These approaches aim to facilitate more\neffective learning by approximating gradients or leveraging biologically\ninspired mechanisms to adjust synaptic weights, thereby striving to close the\nperformance gap while retaining the efficiency benefits.9\n\n### 2.4. Region-Specific Inspirations: From Visual Cortex to Higher Cognition\n\nBeyond general neural network architectures, neuroscience offers granular\ninspiration from specific brain regions, each specialized for distinct\ncognitive functions. Mimicking these regional principles can imbue AI models\nwith specialized capabilities, pushing the boundaries of artificial\nintelligence.\n\n#### 2.4.1. Hippocampus-Inspired Models: Memory, Navigation, and Episodic\nLearning\n\nThe hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation, serves as a\npowerful inspiration for AI researchers designing models capable of human-like\nepisodic memory.14 These models aim to endow artificial agents with the\nability to rapidly encode novel experiences, sequences of events, and spatial\nroutes, making this information readily available for later recall.14\n\nWhen implemented on specialized neuromorphic hardware, often utilizing Spiking\nNeural Networks (SNNs), these hippocampus-inspired models demonstrate robust\nperformance, inherent noise-tolerance, real-time operation, and remarkable\nenergy efficiency.14 They enable AI systems to construct internal cognitive\nmaps of their environments, remember the precise paths taken to achieve goals,\nand even \"replay\" those paths when needed, thereby providing a sophisticated\nsense of place and route memory.14\n\nThe utility of hippocampus-inspired memory models extends significantly to\npredictive analytics. These models enhance predictive capabilities by helping\nAI organize newly acquired information in the context of prior memories. This\nprocess leads to improved forecasting accuracy and anomaly detection in\nsequential data, such as time-series events or user behavior logs.14 This\ndevelopment indicates that a biologically inspired memory system is not merely\nabout storing and retrieving past events, but also about enabling proactive,\ncontext-aware decision-making and forecasting, a critical aspect of advanced\nintelligence.\n\nPractical applications of these models are diverse, including advanced\nnavigation systems for autonomous vehicles and drones, where they can learn\nand recall optimal routes even in dynamic environments.14 In robotics, they\nfacilitate the learning and reliable repetition of complex action sequences.\nFurthermore, they enhance AI-assisted decision-making by allowing systems to\ndraw upon contextual recall of past interactions, leading to more informed and\nadaptable choices.14\n\n#### 2.4.2. Neocortex-Inspired Models: Hierarchical Processing and\nCompositionality\n\nThe neocortex, the seat of higher cognitive functions in the human brain,\nprovides inspiration for models like the Active Predictive Coding (APC)\nframework, which significantly enhances AI's ability to solve complex problems\nwith less data.16 These models are grounded in the brain's hierarchical\ngenerative model, which continuously predicts the consequences of actions and\nrefines its hypotheses based on incoming sensory input.16\n\nThe anatomy of the neocortex reveals a \"tight coupling\" between sensory and\nmotor processes, or perception and action. This principle is mirrored in\nreinforcement learning's generative models, which link an agent's motor output\nto the sensory input it receives from the environment.16 A pivotal feature of\nneocortex-inspired models is compositionality: the inherent ability to break\ndown complicated, abstract problems into smaller, more manageable, and\nreusable parts.16 This approach offers a powerful solution to the \"data\nhunger\" and \"catastrophic forgetting\" often observed in traditional AI models,\nwhich typically require vast amounts of new data for each novel problem.16\n\nBy reusing learned policy functions for simpler sub-tasks, the APC model\nenables AI to generalize quickly with less data, effectively applying\npreviously acquired knowledge to new scenarios.16 This principle is\nuniversally applicable across various domains, from refining motor control to\nenhancing visual perception and learning.16 The MICrONS project, for example,\nhas made significant strides by meticulously mapping the mouse visual cortex,\nlinking neural activity with detailed morphology and connectivity. This rich\ndataset and the tools developed from it provide critical inspiration for\ndesigning next-generation AI models based on the intricate circuits of the\ncortex.15 The ability to decompose complex tasks into reusable components\nfundamentally transforms how AI learns and generalizes, moving towards a more\nhuman-like cognitive flexibility.\n\n#### 2.4.3. Cerebellum-Inspired Models: Motor Control and Interpretable\nReasoning\n\nThe cerebellum, with its relatively clear and uniform structure, serves as a\nvaluable source of inspiration for AI models, particularly in the domains of\nmotor control, coordination, and learning.18 This brain region plays a\ncritical role in motor learning and the formation of long-term skill memories,\nsuch as riding a bicycle.19\n\nA novel AI model, Sakana AI's Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), draws\ninspiration from biological neural networks by utilizing the synchronization\nof neuron activity as its core reasoning mechanism.17 The CTM incorporates\nprecise timing information at the neuron level, which facilitates more complex\nneural behaviors and decision-making processes. This design allows the model\nto \"think\" through problems step-by-step, resulting in a reasoning process\nthat is both interpretable and remarkably human-like.17\n\nThe interpretability of the CTM has been compellingly demonstrated in various\ntasks. For instance, in maze solving, its attention patterns visibly trace\nhuman-like paths, revealing its planning process.17 In image recognition, the\nCTM's attention moves across features similarly to human visual attention,\nexamining different parts of an image over multiple steps before making a\nclassification decision.17 This step-by-step approach not only enhances the\ntransparency of the AI's behavior but also improves accuracy and energy\nefficiency, as the model can decide to spend less time on simpler images.17\nThis development highlights a pathway to more interpretable intelligence,\nwhich is crucial for building trust in AI systems and for effective debugging\nand improvement.\n\nBeyond motor control, the cerebellum implements sophisticated supervised\nlearning principles that offer rich inspiration for next-generation machine\nlearning algorithms.20 These principles include extensive preprocessing of\ninput representations (akin to feature engineering in AI), a massively\nrecurrent circuit architecture, linear input-output computations, adaptive\nplasticity across multiple timescales, and the use of sophisticated,\npredictive instructive signals for error correction.20 These computational\ninsights from the cerebellum provide a robust framework for developing AI\nsystems that can learn complex tasks with greater precision and adaptability.\n\n## 3\\. AI-Driven Tools for Deciphering Neural Complexity\n\nThe application of AI and machine learning (ML) techniques has profoundly\ntransformed neuroscience, providing unprecedented capabilities for analyzing\nthe brain's intricate structure and function. These AI-driven tools are not\nmerely augmenting traditional methods but are enabling entirely new avenues of\ndiscovery and clinical application.\n\n### 3.1. Advanced Neuroimaging and Signal Processing\n\nAI is revolutionizing neurophysiology by significantly enhancing the precision\nand efficiency of assessing brain and nervous system function.33 AI-driven\nneurophysiological assessment integrates machine learning, deep neural\nnetworks, and advanced data analytics to process complex data derived from\ntechniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG).33\nThis technological synergy facilitates the detection of subtle neural patterns\nthat might otherwise be missed by human analysis, leading to earlier and more\naccurate diagnoses of neurological disorders like epilepsy and Alzheimer's\ndisease.1\n\nDeep Learning (DL) has been extensively applied to the analysis of various\nbrain imaging modalities, including structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), EEG, and Magnetoencephalography (MEG).1 DL\napplications in this domain include classification, detection, localization,\nregistration, and segmentation of medical images, all crucial for\nunderstanding brain pathology.38\n\nMEG, a cutting-edge neuroimaging technique, offers unique advantages. It\nmeasures intricate brain dynamics with an unparalleled combination of high\ntemporal and spatial precision, providing a direct measure of the brain's\nelectrophysiological activity on a millisecond scale, unlike fMRI which\nmeasures slower hemodynamic responses.35 MEG's reduced susceptibility to\nspatial smearing compared to EEG makes it particularly well-suited for source\nreconstruction, which helps identify the neural sources underlying surface-\nlevel recordings with greater anatomical precision.35 This capability is vital\nfor understanding complex brain functions like language processing and\ndecision-making.35\n\nAI tools also facilitate real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, which\ncan significantly improve patient outcomes in critical care and\nneurorehabilitation settings.33 The ability of AI to process vast, high-\ndimensional neural data reveals subtle patterns beyond human detection,\nleading to earlier and more precise diagnoses. This represents a fundamental\nshift from reactive symptom management to proactive, data-driven intervention.\n\n### 3.2. Decoding Neural Codes and Information Representation\n\nAI and ML techniques are indispensable for analyzing complex brain activity\nrecordings and disentangling neural patterns, providing a clearer picture of\nhow the brain encodes and processes information.41 The Deconvolutional\nUnrolled Neural Learning (DUNL) framework, for instance, is a novel machine\nlearning approach that decomposes time series neural signals into\ninterpretable \"kernels.\" These kernels represent fundamental components of\nneural data, helping scientists understand how individual neurons or\npopulations of neurons respond to external events, even when multiple stimuli\nare present (multiplexing).41 The development of \"white-box\" AI models like\nDUNL, which offer transparency into their decision-making processes, is\ncrucial for moving beyond opaque predictions to actual mechanistic\nunderstanding of brain functions.\n\nVarious machine learning algorithms are employed for neural decoding, mapping\nneural activity to behavior or stimuli. These include linear models like the\nWiener filter, non-linear approaches such as Support Vector Regression (SVR)\nand XGBoost, and different types of neural networks like Feedforward Neural\nNetworks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.42 Probabilistic models like the Kalman\nfilter and Naive Bayes are also used to estimate hidden states and predict\noutcomes based on neural activity.42\n\nDimensionality reduction techniques are constantly used in neuroscience to\nanalyze high-dimensional neural data.43 Methods like Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and autoencoders\ntransform complex datasets into lower-dimensional spaces, retaining meaningful\nproperties while making analysis computationally tractable.43 This not only\ncompresses data for easier analysis and visualization but also helps\nneuroscientists investigate the underlying low-dimensional structure of neural\npopulation activity and how it is formed.44\n\nCausal inference, often powered by AI technologies such as supervised\nlearning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and neural networks,\nis applied in brain mapping to understand the flow of information between\ndifferent brain regions.47 This approach is vital for identifying causal\nrelationships in brain disorders and improving stimulation therapies like deep\nbrain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease and transcranial magnetic\nstimulation (TMS) for major depressive disorder.47 Neural networks have also\nbeen trained to solve causal inference problems in multisensory integration,\nrevealing how the brain decides whether multiple sensory signals originate\nfrom the same or different events.48\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are proving instrumental in deciphering language\nprocessing in the human brain. Studies demonstrate that the internal\ncontextual embeddings of speech and language within LLMs align linearly with\nneural activity patterns in human brain regions associated with speech\ncomprehension and production.51 These models reveal a \"soft hierarchy\" in\nneural processing, where different brain areas prioritize distinct linguistic\nfeatures, and show shared computational principles with the human brain, such\nas pre-onset prediction and post-onset surprise.51 Furthermore, brain-based\nmovie encoding principles have inspired efficient machine learning for movie\nrecognition AI, leading to models like MovieNet that achieve superior\nperformance with less data by mimicking how the visual system processes\nspatiotemporal information.52 The development of computational models as\nexperimental platforms allows researchers to test theories of brain function\nin ways that traditional biological experiments often cannot, providing a\npowerful means to probe the mechanisms of intelligence.\n\n### 3.3. Modeling Cognitive Functions and Neurological Disorders\n\nAI is profoundly impacting our ability to model complex cognitive functions\nand address neurological and psychiatric disorders. Computational models,\noften resembling neural networks, are being developed to simulate brain\nfunctions, providing insights into memory formation and retrieval. For\ninstance, models simulating the interaction between the hippocampus and\nneocortex demonstrate how conceptual representations are formed from\nexperiences, enabling both the recreation of past events and the generation of\nnew ones.21 New memory models like Input-Driven Plasticity (IDP) offer human-\nlike explanations for memory retrieval, showing robustness to noise and\nfiltering out weak memories.54 AI models are also shedding light on decision-\nmaking processes, including how the brain values subjective outcomes, and are\nenhancing our understanding of language processing and cognitive attention.17\n\nThe application of AI in neurological and psychiatric disorders is\ntransforming early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. AI technologies excel\nat uncovering patterns in complex, high-dimensional datasets, which is\ncritical for identifying structural abnormalities linked to disorders like\nAlzheimer's disease and for predicting seizure onset in epilepsy.1 This leads\nto more precise and adaptive treatments and drives personalized medicine.1 The\nability of AI to integrate diverse data, including genomic, omics,\nneuroimaging, and clinical information, and to predict outcomes is\nrevolutionizing diagnosis and treatment from generalized approaches to highly\npersonalized interventions. This is enabling the customization of treatments\nto individual patient needs, particularly for mental health and\nneurodegenerative diseases.67\n\nSpecific disease modeling examples highlight AI's impact:\n\n  * Alzheimer's Disease (AD): AI speech analysis can predict the progression of cognitive impairment to AD with high accuracy. Deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs trained on MRI data, are enhancing diagnostic accuracy and enabling personalized disease progression prediction models.70\n\n  * Parkinson's Disease (PD): Deep learning algorithms, incorporating diagnostic and medication data, can predict PD in its prodromal phase with high accuracy, especially when analyzing early prescription patterns.72 AI also aids in detecting PD signs from hand-drawn spirals by analyzing frequency and pencil-based features.73\n\n  * Depression: Explainable AI models, using polysomnographic phenotype data, can predict depression with high reliability, offering insights into influential features.74 Multimodal AI methods, leveraging speech and video signals, enhance the recognition of depression severity, supporting real-time monitoring.75\n\n  * Schizophrenia: AI models trained on routine clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs), including text-based clinical notes, can predict the progression to schizophrenia with greater accuracy than bipolar disorder.76\n\nComputational psychiatry is leveraging AI to improve precision psychiatry.\nBiophysically realistic neural network (BRNN) models simulate brain functions\nto understand cognitive patterns in mental disorders. Algorithmic\nreinforcement learning (ARL) models are proposed for psychiatric analysis, and\nprobabilistic approaches like Bayesian models (BM) predict mental states and\nbehaviors, accounting for individual variability. Natural Language Processing\n(NLP), combined with LLMs, is increasingly used to identify changes in mental\nstatus from textual data.78\n\nThe acceleration of therapeutic development is another critical benefit. AI\nstreamlines drug discovery processes, identifies novel therapeutic targets,\nand optimizes clinical trial design, significantly reducing the time and cost\nassociated with bringing new therapies to patients.61 This transformative\ncapability is reshaping the landscape of treatments for neurological\ndisorders, offering innovative solutions where traditional research methods\nhave been less effective.61\n\n## 4\\. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Neurofeedback\n\nBrain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) represent a cutting-edge field at the\nintersection of neuroscience and AI, enabling direct communication pathways\nbetween the brain and external devices.40 Unlike traditional human-computer\ninteraction, BCIs bypass the brain's natural output channels\u2014peripheral nerves\nand muscles\u2014by acquiring brain signals, analyzing them to infer user intent,\nand translating these intentions into commands for output devices.40\n\nAI integration has dramatically improved BCI performance by enhancing neural\nsignal decoding, reducing noise, and enabling real-time processing, thereby\nboosting accuracy, speed, and adaptability.40 This enhanced human-machine\nsymbiosis means AI's role in BCIs moves beyond simple control to enable more\nintuitive, adaptive, and even \"effortless\" learning interfaces, blurring the\nlines between human intent and machine action. For instance, AI algorithms can\nprocess dynamic and multivariate brain signal data to uncover patterns\nassociated with cognitive states or objectives, refining BCI system\nperformance in daily use.62\n\nThe applications of AI-enhanced BCIs are diverse and impactful:\n\n  * Assistive Technologies: BCIs allow paralyzed individuals to regain mobility by controlling prosthetic arms or cursors on a computer screen with their thoughts.66 They also enable users who cannot speak or type conventionally to communicate effectively.40\n\n  * Neurorehabilitation and Mental Health: These advancements facilitate applications in neurorehabilitation, helping patients recover motor function, and in mental health interventions, such as managing anxiety disorders or epilepsy by predicting seizure onset.1\n\n  * Cognitive Enhancement and Gaming: The ability to interact with computers using only brain signals has opened new possibilities in gaming, virtual reality, and systems designed to monitor and optimize mental states for improved productivity and learning.40\n\nA significant development is the integration of AI-driven neurofeedback with\nBCI technology. This paradigm allows for the interpretation of cognitive\nsignals\u2014effectively \"reading thoughts\"\u2014to facilitate direct communication with\ndigital interfaces, superseding traditional keyboard and mouse inputs.81 This\nholds substantial promise for implicit and effortless learning and workforce\ntransformation, enabling individuals to acquire new competencies without\nexhaustive explicit study, which is crucial in the rapidly evolving landscape\nof Industry 4.0.81\n\nTo overcome the limitations of single sensor modalities, hybrid BCIs (hBCIs)\nare being developed, combining data from multiple sources such as EEG, fNIRS,\nfMRI, and EMG.40 This multimodal fusion approach aims to leverage the\nstrengths of different techniques, leading to more robust and comprehensive\nBCI systems.\n\n## 5\\. Challenges, Limitations, and Future Directions\n\nDespite the transformative potential of NeuroAI, its full realization is\ncontingent upon addressing several significant technical, methodological, and\nethical challenges.\n\n### 5.1. Technical and Methodological Hurdles\n\nThe sheer scale and complexity of neural data present formidable technical and\nmethodological hurdles. Neuroscience generates vast, high-dimensional, and\noften noisy datasets from various modalities.1 A primary limitation is the\nscarcity of large, labeled, and high-quality datasets, particularly for rare\nneurological diseases.33 This \"data-driven bottleneck\" means that while AI\nexcels at processing vast amounts of information, the quality and\nrepresentativeness of the input data can significantly constrain its\nperformance and generalizability. Unbalanced or limited datasets, often\nlacking demographic diversity, can lead to models that overfit to training\ndata and perform poorly in real-world clinical scenarios.38\n\nComputational constraints also pose a challenge. Implementing complex AI\nalgorithms, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perceptrons,\nrequires significant computational resources.33 This can be an obstacle for\nresearchers with limited access to advanced hardware. Furthermore, despite\nconsiderable progress, notable gaps persist between biological and artificial\nsystems, particularly in achieving human-level generalization and energy\nefficiency.13\n\nA critical methodological issue is the low level of standardization in\nevaluating the performance of ML models in neurological research.82 The lack\nof standardized protocols makes it difficult to compare results across\ndifferent studies, as metrics and methodologies often vary. This hinders the\nidentification of optimal models and configurations for specific neurological\nconditions.\n\n### 5.2. Ethical and Societal Implications\n\nThe deep integration of AI with neuroscience, particularly through BCIs,\nraises profound ethical and societal questions that demand careful\nconsideration and proactive governance.\n\n  * Cognitive Privacy and Neural Data Security: The ability to \"read\" and interpret brain activity through BCIs raises significant concerns about cognitive privacy. There is a growing risk of brain data being extracted through malicious external actions or unauthorized access to BCI functions, leading to what some term \"neurocrime\".83 The current immaturity of BCI system security creates vulnerabilities, and the legal categorization of brain data under existing regulations like GDPR remains unclear, especially for data derived from non-medical devices.83\n\n  * Cognitive Manipulation and Autonomy: The potential for external influence on BCI-mediated actions raises fundamental questions about individual autonomy and agency.83 If AI systems can interpret or even influence thoughts and feelings, the line between autonomous human action and machine-driven behavior becomes blurred, necessitating a re-evaluation of theories of action and liability.83\n\n  * Personhood and Human Dignity: As AI systems increasingly mimic human cognitive capabilities, the very definition of personhood is challenged.84 Concerns arise about how the integration of BCIs might affect social identity and self-perception, potentially leading to a transhumanist future where the distinction between humans and \"cyborgs\" becomes ambiguous.83 There is also a risk that the sophistication of AI could lead to elevated societal expectations of human performance, potentially narrowing the definition of \"normal\" human cognition and further marginalizing individuals with cognitive disabilities.84 This indicates that the ability of AI to interact directly with and interpret brain activity raises fundamental questions about what it means to be human, necessitating robust ethical frameworks.\n\n  * Bias and Discrimination: AI systems are trained on vast datasets, and if these datasets contain societal biases, the AI can learn, reinforce, and even amplify existing discriminations.84 This could lead to discriminatory outcomes for vulnerable populations, such as biased decisions in healthcare, employment, or access to services.84\n\n  * Accessibility and Social Justice: Ensuring equitable access to advanced neurotechnologies is crucial to prevent exacerbating existing societal inequalities.83\n\n### 5.3. Future Research Directions and Breakthroughs\n\nThe future of NeuroAI hinges on a concerted effort to overcome current\nlimitations and pursue new avenues of research.\n\n  * Hybrid AI Models and Explainable AI: Future research should emphasize the development of hybrid AI models that combine different AI techniques to leverage their respective strengths, leading to more robust and accurate systems.80 Crucially, there is a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) frameworks, which make the decision-making processes of AI models transparent and understandable. This is vital for building trust, ensuring accountability, and facilitating the responsible adoption of AI-driven BCIs and other neurotechnologies.2\n\n  * Real-time Capabilities and Dataset Standardization: Improving the speed and efficiency of BCI systems to enable immediate and seamless interaction between the brain and external devices is a key direction.80 Concurrently, creating uniform, high-quality, and diverse datasets is essential to facilitate research, development, and comparison across different BCI systems and neurological models.80\n\n  * Targeted Data Collection and Algorithm Exploration: There is a critical need for investment in data collection for rare neurological diseases, enabling the development of accurate ML models for these conditions.82 Researchers should also explore the potential of underutilized algorithms, which may yield new discoveries beyond those extensively studied in the literature.82\n\n  * Integration of Multimodal Data: A key future direction is the integration of multimodal data, such as medical images, genetic data, and clinical biomarkers, into ML models. This multidisciplinary approach is expected to lead to improved identification of neurological disease mechanisms and direct implications for personalized treatments.82\n\n  * Computational Tools for Resource Optimization: Developing computational tools that prevent resource limitations will be crucial, allowing research to be conducted without the need for prohibitively expensive advanced hardware.82\n\n  * NeuroAI for AI Safety and Alignment: A critical area of future research involves leveraging cognitive neuroscience principles, such as bounded rationality, attention, or uncertainty minimization, to inspire safer AI systems. This aims to develop AI that is not only intelligent but also predictable, steerable, and aligned with human values, addressing the ethical implications proactively.2 This ethical innovation imperative highlights that future progress hinges not just on technical advancement but on proactive ethical development, ensuring AI aligns with human values and benefits all.\n\n  * Deeper Biological Understanding for AI: Continued research into the intricate mechanisms of the human brain will provide further insights to inspire advanced AI systems.6 This includes understanding how the brain manages learning and memory with minimal power, how it achieves human-level generalization, and the role of non-neuronal cells like astrocytes in complex computations and memory.1\n\n## 6\\. Conclusion\n\nThe symbiotic evolution of neuroscience and AI represents one of the most\ndynamic and promising frontiers in contemporary science.
