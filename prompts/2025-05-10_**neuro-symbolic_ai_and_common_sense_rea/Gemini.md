# **Neuro-Symbolic AI: Bridging the Gap Towards Human-like Understanding**

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is constantly evolving, with
researchers striving to create systems that can not only process information
but also understand and reason about the world in ways similar to humans.
Neuro-symbolic AI has emerged as a promising direction in this pursuit, aiming
to construct sophisticated computational AI models by integrating neural and
symbolic learning and reasoning.1 This hybrid approach seeks to harness the
complementary strengths of neural networks, which excel at pattern recognition
and learning from vast amounts of data, and symbolic AI, which is adept at
logical reasoning and knowledge representation.1 By overcoming the inherent
limitations of each paradigm when used in isolation, neuro-symbolic AI
endeavors to build robust AI capable of reasoning, learning, and cognitive
modeling, ultimately bridging the gap towards human-like understanding.3 A
critical component of human intelligence that remains a significant challenge
for current AI systems is common sense reasoning.4 This report will delve into
how neuro-symbolic AI is tackling this challenge, exploring the integration of
neural and symbolic approaches to imbue AI with the capacity for common sense,
thereby paving the way for more human-like understanding.

## **The Imperative of Common Sense in Artificial Intelligence**

While purely neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, they often fall short when it comes to logical reasoning,
abstraction, and grasping the subtleties of language and context.2 These
models can often operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand
the rationale behind their decisions, thus limiting their explainability and
robustness.6 Conversely, purely symbolic systems, while powerful in logical
deduction and providing clear explanations, tend to be brittle and require
extensive manual effort to encode knowledge. They also struggle with the
inherent noise and uncertainty of real-world data and perceptual tasks.2
Furthermore, as the volume and complexity of knowledge increase, symbolic
systems encounter significant scalability issues.8 A fundamental aspect of
human intelligence that underpins our ability to navigate the world and
interact with it effectively is common sense knowledge. This encompasses our
understanding of everyday objects, events, and situations, as well as an
intuitive grasp of physics and psychology.4 Without this common sense, AI
systems face limitations in their ability to adapt to new scenarios, exhibit
robustness in the face of unexpected inputs, provide understandable
explanations for their actions, and collaborate seamlessly with humans.4 The
motivation behind neuro-symbolic AI lies in its potential to overcome these
individual limitations by merging the strengths of neural and symbolic
approaches, aiming to create AI systems with more general and human-like
reasoning capabilities.2

## **Neuro-Symbolic Architectures for Common Sense**

To integrate learning and reasoning for common sense, various architectural approaches have been proposed in the field of neuro-symbolic AI. Henry Kautz's taxonomy offers a foundational classification, outlining categories such as Symbolic Neural symbolic, where symbolic inputs and outputs are processed by neural networks, commonly seen in natural language processing.3 Another category, Symbolic[Neural], involves using symbolic techniques to invoke neural capabilities, exemplified by systems like AlphaGo.3 Neural | Symbolic architectures utilize neural networks to interpret perceptual data as symbols for subsequent symbolic reasoning.3 Neural: Symbolic â†’ Neural approaches employ symbolic reasoning to generate or label training data for neural networks.3 Neural_Symbolic\_ architectures generate neural networks from symbolic rules, as seen in Neural Theorem Provers.3 Lastly, Neural architectures allow neural models to directly call upon symbolic reasoning engines.3 Beyond this, a distinction can be made between composite frameworks, which maintain separate symbolic and neural components, and monolithic frameworks, which deeply integrate logical reasoning within neural networks. Composite frameworks can be further categorized based on the supervision of the neural component, either direct or indirect, while monolithic frameworks include logically wired neural networks and tensorised logic programs. These diverse architectures represent different strategies for combining the distinct advantages of neural networks and symbolic reasoning. The selection of a specific architecture often depends on the particular task at hand and the desired emphasis on learning, reasoning, or other crucial properties such as interpretability and the need for large amounts of training data.7 Hybrid architectures, in general, aim to capitalize on large-scale learning while harnessing the representational and computational power inherent in symbol manipulation.3

## **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Neuro-Symbolic Systems**

A cornerstone of neuro-symbolic AI in addressing common sense reasoning lies
in the effective representation and manipulation of knowledge. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) serve as a pivotal element in this endeavor, acting as a bridge
between the structured world of symbolic logic and the continuous space of
deep learning.12 They provide a structured format to represent knowledge using
nodes for entities and edges for the relationships between them, allowing
neuro-symbolic systems to reason and make inferences. Ontologies further
contribute by offering structured frameworks for organizing knowledge within
specific domains, enabling AI systems to understand and reason about complex
concepts and their interrelations.13 Logic programming languages, such as
Prolog, play a crucial role in formally representing knowledge and performing
logical deduction within neuro-symbolic AI, particularly in applications
demanding explicit reasoning.15 These symbolic methods collectively enhance
the transparency and interpretability of neuro-symbolic systems, making their
reasoning processes more understandable and verifiable.6 By leveraging these
knowledge representation techniques, neuro-symbolic systems can learn from
data while simultaneously incorporating explicit knowledge and rules, leading
to more robust and explainable AI.2

## **Acquiring Common Sense Knowledge in Neuro-Symbolic AI**

A significant hurdle in achieving human-like understanding is the acquisition
of common sense knowledge, which is often tacit and challenging to
formalize.18 Neuro-symbolic AI explores various methods to address this. These
include leveraging natural language processing to read and extract information
from text, learning from observed human behavior, employing interactive
systems like chatbots to elicit knowledge, constructing knowledge graphs from
diverse sources, utilizing expert knowledge, and even employing crowdsourcing
techniques.18 A key aspect is enabling neuro-symbolic systems to learn from
data while also integrating explicit knowledge and rules.2 This involves the
ability to learn abstract concepts and the rules that govern them from
linguistic data.21 One promising approach involves using neural networks to
identify patterns and features in data, which are then used to automatically
generate symbolic rules and build knowledge graphs.22 Furthermore, the
emergence of foundation models and large language models (LLMs) presents new
opportunities for enhancing neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning. These
models, trained on vast amounts of data, possess a wealth of implicit
knowledge that can be leveraged by neuro-symbolic systems.23 LLMs can also
assist in the crucial tasks of ontology engineering and prompt engineering,
further facilitating the development of neuro-symbolic AI with common sense.25

## **Reasoning Mechanisms for Human-like Understanding**

Neuro-symbolic AI aims to replicate human-like understanding by addressing
specific reasoning mechanisms crucial for common sense. This includes
reasoning about causality, intentions, and naive physics. To enable causal
reasoning, neuro-symbolic approaches integrate causal inference techniques
with neural networks and symbolic knowledge, allowing for the understanding of
cause-and-effect relationships and the ability to perform counterfactual
reasoning.5 Reasoning about intentions involves deciphering the underlying
goals and motivations behind actions, often requiring the inference of
implicit presumptions using common sense.3 Systems like CORGI employ neuro-
symbolic theorem proving to uncover these hidden assumptions in natural
language commands.20 Naive physics reasoning, which deals with understanding
how objects interact in the physical world, is tackled by combining symbolic
knowledge with detailed physical simulations.5 For instance, systems can
reason about the behavior of falling objects or the properties of liquids
through this integrated approach.26

## **Applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI with Common Sense Reasoning**

The integration of neuro-symbolic AI with common sense reasoning is finding
applications across various domains. In robotics, it enables robots to better
perceive their surroundings, make more informed decisions, plan actions
effectively, and interact with humans in a more intuitive manner.7 For
question answering, it allows AI systems to understand the context of queries,
resolve ambiguities, and perform complex reasoning to provide more accurate
and explainable answers.7 In natural language understanding, neuro-symbolic AI
enhances tasks such as machine translation and information extraction by
incorporating logical reasoning alongside neural networks' comprehension
abilities.3 Beyond these, applications extend to healthcare for diagnostics
and treatment planning, finance for fraud detection and risk assessment,
cybersecurity for threat analysis, manufacturing for predictive maintenance,
retail for personalized recommendations, and education for creating adaptive
learning experiences.27 The ability of these systems to provide more
transparent and understandable reasoning is particularly advantageous in
safety-critical and high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous
vehicles.9

## **Challenges and Limitations in Scaling Common Sense Reasoning**

Despite the significant progress, scaling common sense reasoning in neuro-
symbolic AI presents several challenges. Scalability remains a major hurdle,
especially as the complexity of knowledge and the depth of reasoning required
increase.3 Traditional symbolic AI has long faced a "knowledge acquisition
bottleneck," where the manual encoding of vast amounts of common sense
knowledge becomes impractical.8 Learning new symbolic rules from data in a
robust and scalable manner is an active area of research.1 Maintaining logical
consistency when integrating the rigid rules of symbolic AI with the
probabilistic nature of neural networks is another key implementation
challenge.30 Furthermore, the computational demands of managing and reasoning
over large knowledge bases while simultaneously running neural computations
can lead to concerns about efficiency.30 Ultimately, current AI systems,
including those employing neuro-symbolic approaches, still fall short of
possessing true common sense and struggle to adapt to novel situations without
extensive prior training.4

## **Evaluation and Benchmarking of Common Sense in Neuro-Symbolic AI**

Evaluating the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic AI systems in achieving common
sense reasoning is a complex task. It requires assessing both the neural and
symbolic components individually, as well as their integration.6 While several
benchmarks for common sense reasoning exist, such as the Winograd Schema
Challenge and the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), they have
limitations in truly capturing the breadth and depth of human common sense.32
These benchmarks may focus on specific aspects of reasoning or be susceptible
to solutions that do not genuinely reflect common sense understanding.34 There
is a recognized need for new evaluation paradigms that can better assess the
holistic common sense reasoning abilities of hybrid AI systems.36 This
includes the development of more realistic and interactive tasks, the creation
of novel metrics for evaluation, and the use of simulation environments to
test common sense in dynamic settings.38

## **Future Directions and Expert Perspectives**

The future of neuro-symbolic AI in achieving human-like common sense reasoning
is marked by several promising trends. These include a focus on anticipatory
thinking, enabling AI to predict future events; meta-cognition, allowing AI to
reason about its own reasoning; and advancements in causality and
counterfactual reasoning.4 Harnessing common sense from diverse modalities,
supporting multilinguality, exploring lateral thinking, and fostering human-AI
teaming are also key directions.38 Experts in the field believe that neuro-
symbolic AI represents a significant step towards more human-like language
understanding and reasoning by effectively combining data-driven learning with
structured symbolic reasoning.3 However, fundamental research questions
remain, such as determining the optimal ways to integrate neural and symbolic
architectures, how to represent and extract symbolic knowledge within neural
networks, how to effectively learn and reason with common sense knowledge, and
how to handle abstract concepts.3 A crucial area for future development is the
creation of neuro-symbolic systems capable of learning new symbolic rules from
data and reasoning with them in a flexible manner.40 There is also a growing
consensus on the importance of interdisciplinary research, particularly in
ensuring the explainability and trustworthiness of neuro-symbolic AI systems
as they become more sophisticated.7

## **Conclusion**

Neuro-symbolic AI stands as a compelling paradigm that seeks to bridge the gap
towards human-like understanding by synergistically combining the strengths of
neural networks and symbolic AI. By focusing on common sense reasoning, this
field addresses a critical limitation of current AI systems. The use of
knowledge graphs, ontologies, and logic programming provides powerful tools
for representing and manipulating the vast and intricate knowledge that
constitutes common sense. While significant strides have been made in various
applications, the journey towards truly human-like common sense reasoning is
fraught with challenges, particularly in scaling these systems and developing
robust evaluation methods. Nevertheless, the future of neuro-symbolic AI is
bright, with ongoing research exploring advanced reasoning mechanisms,
seamless integration techniques, and innovative approaches to knowledge
acquisition. Expert perspectives underscore the transformative potential of
this field in creating AI systems that are not only intelligent but also
understandable, reliable, and capable of interacting with the world and with
humans in a more meaningful and intuitive way.
