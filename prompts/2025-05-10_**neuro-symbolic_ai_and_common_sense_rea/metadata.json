  "response": "#  **Neuro-Symbolic AI: Bridging the Gap Towards Human-like Understanding**\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence (AI) is constantly evolving, with\nresearchers striving to create systems that can not only process information\nbut also understand and reason about the world in ways similar to humans.\nNeuro-symbolic AI has emerged as a promising direction in this pursuit, aiming\nto construct sophisticated computational AI models by integrating neural and\nsymbolic learning and reasoning.1 This hybrid approach seeks to harness the\ncomplementary strengths of neural networks, which excel at pattern recognition\nand learning from vast amounts of data, and symbolic AI, which is adept at\nlogical reasoning and knowledge representation.1 By overcoming the inherent\nlimitations of each paradigm when used in isolation, neuro-symbolic AI\nendeavors to build robust AI capable of reasoning, learning, and cognitive\nmodeling, ultimately bridging the gap towards human-like understanding.3 A\ncritical component of human intelligence that remains a significant challenge\nfor current AI systems is common sense reasoning.4 This report will delve into\nhow neuro-symbolic AI is tackling this challenge, exploring the integration of\nneural and symbolic approaches to imbue AI with the capacity for common sense,\nthereby paving the way for more human-like understanding.\n\n##  **The Imperative of Common Sense in Artificial Intelligence**\n\nWhile purely neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various\ndomains, they often fall short when it comes to logical reasoning,\nabstraction, and grasping the subtleties of language and context.2 These\nmodels can often operate as \"black boxes,\" making it difficult to understand\nthe rationale behind their decisions, thus limiting their explainability and\nrobustness.6 Conversely, purely symbolic systems, while powerful in logical\ndeduction and providing clear explanations, tend to be brittle and require\nextensive manual effort to encode knowledge. They also struggle with the\ninherent noise and uncertainty of real-world data and perceptual tasks.2\nFurthermore, as the volume and complexity of knowledge increase, symbolic\nsystems encounter significant scalability issues.8 A fundamental aspect of\nhuman intelligence that underpins our ability to navigate the world and\ninteract with it effectively is common sense knowledge. This encompasses our\nunderstanding of everyday objects, events, and situations, as well as an\nintuitive grasp of physics and psychology.4 Without this common sense, AI\nsystems face limitations in their ability to adapt to new scenarios, exhibit\nrobustness in the face of unexpected inputs, provide understandable\nexplanations for their actions, and collaborate seamlessly with humans.4 The\nmotivation behind neuro-symbolic AI lies in its potential to overcome these\nindividual limitations by merging the strengths of neural and symbolic\napproaches, aiming to create AI systems with more general and human-like\nreasoning capabilities.2\n\n##  **Neuro-Symbolic Architectures for Common Sense**\n\nTo integrate learning and reasoning for common sense, various architectural approaches have been proposed in the field of neuro-symbolic AI. Henry Kautz's taxonomy offers a foundational classification, outlining categories such as Symbolic Neural symbolic, where symbolic inputs and outputs are processed by neural networks, commonly seen in natural language processing.3 Another category, Symbolic[Neural], involves using symbolic techniques to invoke neural capabilities, exemplified by systems like AlphaGo.3 Neural | Symbolic architectures utilize neural networks to interpret perceptual data as symbols for subsequent symbolic reasoning.3 Neural: Symbolic \u2192 Neural approaches employ symbolic reasoning to generate or label training data for neural networks.3 Neural_Symbolic_ architectures generate neural networks from symbolic rules, as seen in Neural Theorem Provers.3 Lastly, Neural architectures allow neural models to directly call upon symbolic reasoning engines.3 Beyond this, a distinction can be made between composite frameworks, which maintain separate symbolic and neural components, and monolithic frameworks, which deeply integrate logical reasoning within neural networks. Composite frameworks can be further categorized based on the supervision of the neural component, either direct or indirect, while monolithic frameworks include logically wired neural networks and tensorised logic programs. These diverse architectures represent different strategies for combining the distinct advantages of neural networks and symbolic reasoning. The selection of a specific architecture often depends on the particular task at hand and the desired emphasis on learning, reasoning, or other crucial properties such as interpretability and the need for large amounts of training data.7 Hybrid architectures, in general, aim to capitalize on large-scale learning while harnessing the representational and computational power inherent in symbol manipulation.3\n\n##  **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Neuro-Symbolic Systems**\n\nA cornerstone of neuro-symbolic AI in addressing common sense reasoning lies\nin the effective representation and manipulation of knowledge. Knowledge\ngraphs (KGs) serve as a pivotal element in this endeavor, acting as a bridge\nbetween the structured world of symbolic logic and the continuous space of\ndeep learning.12 They provide a structured format to represent knowledge using\nnodes for entities and edges for the relationships between them, allowing\nneuro-symbolic systems to reason and make inferences. Ontologies further\ncontribute by offering structured frameworks for organizing knowledge within\nspecific domains, enabling AI systems to understand and reason about complex\nconcepts and their interrelations.13 Logic programming languages, such as\nProlog, play a crucial role in formally representing knowledge and performing\nlogical deduction within neuro-symbolic AI, particularly in applications\ndemanding explicit reasoning.15 These symbolic methods collectively enhance\nthe transparency and interpretability of neuro-symbolic systems, making their\nreasoning processes more understandable and verifiable.6 By leveraging these\nknowledge representation techniques, neuro-symbolic systems can learn from\ndata while simultaneously incorporating explicit knowledge and rules, leading\nto more robust and explainable AI.2\n\n##  **Acquiring Common Sense Knowledge in Neuro-Symbolic AI**\n\nA significant hurdle in achieving human-like understanding is the acquisition\nof common sense knowledge, which is often tacit and challenging to\nformalize.18 Neuro-symbolic AI explores various methods to address this. These\ninclude leveraging natural language processing to read and extract information\nfrom text, learning from observed human behavior, employing interactive\nsystems like chatbots to elicit knowledge, constructing knowledge graphs from\ndiverse sources, utilizing expert knowledge, and even employing crowdsourcing\ntechniques.18 A key aspect is enabling neuro-symbolic systems to learn from\ndata while also integrating explicit knowledge and rules.2 This involves the\nability to learn abstract concepts and the rules that govern them from\nlinguistic data.21 One promising approach involves using neural networks to\nidentify patterns and features in data, which are then used to automatically\ngenerate symbolic rules and build knowledge graphs.22 Furthermore, the\nemergence of foundation models and large language models (LLMs) presents new\nopportunities for enhancing neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning. These\nmodels, trained on vast amounts of data, possess a wealth of implicit\nknowledge that can be leveraged by neuro-symbolic systems.23 LLMs can also\nassist in the crucial tasks of ontology engineering and prompt engineering,\nfurther facilitating the development of neuro-symbolic AI with common sense.25\n\n##  **Reasoning Mechanisms for Human-like Understanding**\n\nNeuro-symbolic AI aims to replicate human-like understanding by addressing\nspecific reasoning mechanisms crucial for common sense. This includes\nreasoning about causality, intentions, and naive physics. To enable causal\nreasoning, neuro-symbolic approaches integrate causal inference techniques\nwith neural networks and symbolic knowledge, allowing for the understanding of\ncause-and-effect relationships and the ability to perform counterfactual\nreasoning.5 Reasoning about intentions involves deciphering the underlying\ngoals and motivations behind actions, often requiring the inference of\nimplicit presumptions using common sense.3 Systems like CORGI employ neuro-\nsymbolic theorem proving to uncover these hidden assumptions in natural\nlanguage commands.20 Naive physics reasoning, which deals with understanding\nhow objects interact in the physical world, is tackled by combining symbolic\nknowledge with detailed physical simulations.5 For instance, systems can\nreason about the behavior of falling objects or the properties of liquids\nthrough this integrated approach.26\n\n##  **Applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI with Common Sense Reasoning**\n\nThe integration of neuro-symbolic AI with common sense reasoning is finding\napplications across various domains. In robotics, it enables robots to better\nperceive their surroundings, make more informed decisions, plan actions\neffectively, and interact with humans in a more intuitive manner.7 For\nquestion answering, it allows AI systems to understand the context of queries,\nresolve ambiguities, and perform complex reasoning to provide more accurate\nand explainable answers.7 In natural language understanding, neuro-symbolic AI\nenhances tasks such as machine translation and information extraction by\nincorporating logical reasoning alongside neural networks' comprehension\nabilities.3 Beyond these, applications extend to healthcare for diagnostics\nand treatment planning, finance for fraud detection and risk assessment,\ncybersecurity for threat analysis, manufacturing for predictive maintenance,\nretail for personalized recommendations, and education for creating adaptive\nlearning experiences.27 The ability of these systems to provide more\ntransparent and understandable reasoning is particularly advantageous in\nsafety-critical and high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous\nvehicles.9\n\n##  **Challenges and Limitations in Scaling Common Sense Reasoning**\n\nDespite the significant progress, scaling common sense reasoning in neuro-\nsymbolic AI presents several challenges. Scalability remains a major hurdle,\nespecially as the complexity of knowledge and the depth of reasoning required\nincrease.3 Traditional symbolic AI has long faced a \"knowledge acquisition\nbottleneck,\" where the manual encoding of vast amounts of common sense\nknowledge becomes impractical.8 Learning new symbolic rules from data in a\nrobust and scalable manner is an active area of research.1 Maintaining logical\nconsistency when integrating the rigid rules of symbolic AI with the\nprobabilistic nature of neural networks is another key implementation\nchallenge.30 Furthermore, the computational demands of managing and reasoning\nover large knowledge bases while simultaneously running neural computations\ncan lead to concerns about efficiency.30 Ultimately, current AI systems,\nincluding those employing neuro-symbolic approaches, still fall short of\npossessing true common sense and struggle to adapt to novel situations without\nextensive prior training.4\n\n##  **Evaluation and Benchmarking of Common Sense in Neuro-Symbolic AI**\n\nEvaluating the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic AI systems in achieving common\nsense reasoning is a complex task. It requires assessing both the neural and\nsymbolic components individually, as well as their integration.6 While several\nbenchmarks for common sense reasoning exist, such as the Winograd Schema\nChallenge and the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), they have\nlimitations in truly capturing the breadth and depth of human common sense.32\nThese benchmarks may focus on specific aspects of reasoning or be susceptible\nto solutions that do not genuinely reflect common sense understanding.34 There\nis a recognized need for new evaluation paradigms that can better assess the\nholistic common sense reasoning abilities of hybrid AI systems.36 This\nincludes the development of more realistic and interactive tasks, the creation\nof novel metrics for evaluation, and the use of simulation environments to\ntest common sense in dynamic settings.38\n\n##  **Future Directions and Expert Perspectives**\n\nThe future of neuro-symbolic AI in achieving human-like common sense reasoning\nis marked by several promising trends. These include a focus on anticipatory\nthinking, enabling AI to predict future events; meta-cognition, allowing AI to\nreason about its own reasoning; and advancements in causality and\ncounterfactual reasoning.4 Harnessing common sense from diverse modalities,\nsupporting multilinguality, exploring lateral thinking, and fostering human-AI\nteaming are also key directions.38 Experts in the field believe that neuro-\nsymbolic AI represents a significant step towards more human-like language\nunderstanding and reasoning by effectively combining data-driven learning with\nstructured symbolic reasoning.3 However, fundamental research questions\nremain, such as determining the optimal ways to integrate neural and symbolic\narchitectures, how to represent and extract symbolic knowledge within neural\nnetworks, how to effectively learn and reason with common sense knowledge, and\nhow to handle abstract concepts.3 A crucial area for future development is the\ncreation of neuro-symbolic systems capable of learning new symbolic rules from\ndata and reasoning with them in a flexible manner.40 There is also a growing\nconsensus on the importance of interdisciplinary research, particularly in\nensuring the explainability and trustworthiness of neuro-symbolic AI systems\nas they become more sophisticated.7\n\n##  **Conclusion**\n\nNeuro-symbolic AI stands as a compelling paradigm that seeks to bridge the gap\ntowards human-like understanding by synergistically combining the strengths of\nneural networks and symbolic AI. By focusing on common sense reasoning, this\nfield addresses a critical limitation of current AI systems. The use of\nknowledge graphs, ontologies, and logic programming provides powerful tools\nfor representing and manipulating the vast and intricate knowledge that\nconstitutes common sense. While significant strides have been made in various\napplications, the journey towards truly human-like common sense reasoning is\nfraught with challenges, particularly in scaling these systems and developing\nrobust evaluation methods. Nevertheless, the future of neuro-symbolic AI is\nbright, with ongoing research exploring advanced reasoning mechanisms,\nseamless integration techniques, and innovative approaches to knowledge\nacquisition. Expert perspectives underscore the transformative potential of\nthis field in creating AI systems that are not only intelligent but also\nunderstandable, reliable, and capable of interacting with the world and with\nhumans in a more meaningful and intuitive way.\n\n####  Works cited\n\n  1.
