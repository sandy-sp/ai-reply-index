# Prompt

i want to create a prompt database. but the prompt system is not standardized, every one have their own system. i want to come up with a universal system to classify different types of prompts and its sub classification. rather than a SQL i think this kind of database requires NOSQL, i dont know? but i want ask such key questions and self reflect to come up with a system to create a prompt database. start the thought process from here - What is a prompt database and how to create one where a normal human can use it easily?
