# Prompt

**AI for Resilient Autonomous Operations and Scientific Discovery in Extreme
and Unpredictable Environments**

- **Focus Area:** Robotics, Autonomous Systems, AI for Science, Robust AI
- **Prompt Details:** "Undertake a deep research initiative to design and evaluate AI systems capable of sustained, resilient, and adaptive autonomous operation, decision-making, and scientific discovery in extreme, resource-constrained, dynamic, and largely unknown environments (e.g., deep space missions, sub-oceanic exploration, polar research, active volcanic regions, post-disaster zones with collapsed infrastructure). The research should address:
  - **Advanced Perception and Situational Awareness in Degraded Conditions:** AI techniques for robust sensing, sensor fusion, and world modeling in environments with limited visibility, sparse data, unreliable communication, novel sensory inputs (e.g., non-visual), and adversarial conditions.
  - **On-board Learning, Adaptation, and Novelty Handling:** Develop AI architectures that can learn continuously from sparse data, adapt their models and behaviors to unforeseen circumstances or environmental shifts, detect and respond to novel phenomena, and perform self-diagnosis and recovery from partial system failures.
  - **Energy Autonomy and Resource Management:** AI strategies for long-term energy management, efficient power utilization, and potentially in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) to enable extended mission durations without human intervention.
  - **Explainable and Verifiable Autonomous Decision-Making:** Methods to ensure that autonomous decisions, especially in safety-critical situations or during scientific discovery, are explainable, verifiable, and aligned with mission objectives and ethical guidelines. How can human operators maintain meaningful oversight and intervene when necessary in time-delayed remote scenarios?
  - **AI-Driven Hypothesis Generation and Autonomous Experimentation:** Design AI systems that can autonomously generate scientific hypotheses based on incoming data, design and execute experiments to test these hypotheses, and iterate on scientific understanding in remote environments.
  - **Human-Autonomy Teaming for Remote Exploration:** Investigate optimal frameworks for human-autonomy teaming in scenarios characterized by significant communication latencies and bandwidth limitations, focusing on shared situational awareness, adjustable autonomy, and trust calibration between human supervisors and remote AI agents."
- **Keywords for further research:** AI extreme environments, autonomous robotics, robust AI perception, AI space exploration, deep sea AI, AI disaster response, resilient AI systems, autonomous scientific discovery.
