This report examines\nthe interconnected dimensions of ethical decision-making, robust technical\nvalidation, and public trust, all critical for the safe and beneficial\ndeployment of AI. It highlights that universal ethical benchmarks for AI are\nunattainable due to the inherent relativity of human values, necessitating a\nshift towards explicit value alignment and continuous human oversight.\nAchieving system reliability demands a dynamic approach to validation, moving\nbeyond static compliance to continuous assurance, incorporating advanced\nengineering-grade security, and addressing the pervasive issues of data\nquality and algorithmic bias. Furthermore, cultivating public trust is\nparamount, requiring transparent communication, proactive engagement, and a\nnuanced understanding of the psychological factors influencing acceptance,\nespecially in the aftermath of incidents. Ultimately, responsible AI\nintegration requires a multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary commitment to\nadaptive governance, human-centric design, and sustained societal dialogue to\nensure these powerful technologies enhance human well-being and societal\nprogress.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction: The Imperative of Ethical AI in High-Stakes Autonomous\nSystems\n\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence into systems operating with\nincreasing autonomy marks a significant technological advancement. These\nsystems, defined as machine-based entities that perceive their environment\nthrough input data, abstract these perceptions into models, and generate\noutputs to achieve specific objectives, possess varying degrees of self-\ngovernance.1 The deployment of such autonomous capabilities is rapidly\nexpanding into domains where the consequences of failure are profoundly\nsevere, classifying them as \"high-stakes.\"\n\nThese critical sectors include healthcare, exemplified by autonomous surgical\nrobots and diagnostic tools, transportation with self-driving cars and drones,\nvital critical infrastructure such as energy grids, financial services, urban\nplanning, and water utilities, and sensitive national security applications.2\nIn these environments, the potential for systemic failures, whether stemming\nfrom hardware malfunctions, software defects, malicious inputs like\nadversarial attacks, or unforeseen environmental shifts, can lead to\ncatastrophic outcomes. Such failures are not merely operational\ninconveniences; they carry the grave potential for loss of life, widespread\neconomic disruption, or significant environmental harm.4\n\nThe rapid proliferation of AI across these critical sectors underscores an\nurgent need for robust frameworks that can effectively address the complex\nethical, legal, and socio-political concerns that inevitably arise.3\nIntegrating ethical considerations into the very fabric of AI design and\ndeployment is paramount. This ensures that AI technologies genuinely serve to\nenhance human well-being, uphold fundamental rights, and protect individual\nfreedoms, rather than inadvertently perpetuating existing societal biases,\nexacerbating inequalities, or undermining democratic institutions.10 The\nchallenge lies in striking a delicate yet crucial balance: accelerating\ntechnological advancement while maintaining unwavering ethical integrity. This\nrequires ensuring that AI systems are not only technologically sophisticated\nbut also inherently socially responsible and deeply aligned with human\nvalues.5\n\nA fundamental prerequisite for the widespread adoption and safe deployment of\nthese systems is the cultivation and maintenance of public trust. Public\nskepticism and fear, often fueled by legitimate safety concerns and a\nperceived lack of transparency, can significantly impede the realization of\nAI's immense potential societal benefits.12 The successful integration of AI\ninto critical domains thus depends on a holistic approach that intertwines\ntechnical excellence with profound ethical consideration and proactive\nsocietal engagement.\n\nA critical understanding emerging from the analysis of AI risks reveals a deep\ninterdependency between technical and societal factors. The severe, tangible\nconsequences of AI failures in high-stakes domains, such as loss of life or\neconomic disruption, are not solely attributable to technical malfunctions. AI\nrisks are inherently socio-technical, meaning they are profoundly influenced\nby societal dynamics and human behavior, extending beyond purely technical\nflaws.11 This suggests that even an AI system that is technically flawless in\nits design and operation could still lead to harm or face rejection if\ndeployed in a context where societal values are misaligned, or if public trust\nis severely lacking. This understanding implies that the traditional\nseparation between \"safety engineering\" and \"ethics\" is insufficient for AI. A\ntruly holistic and effective risk management strategy must integrate technical\nrobustness with a deep, continuous understanding of human interaction,\nevolving societal values, and the potential for unintended misuse or societal\ndisruption. This broader perspective moves beyond simply preventing physical\nharm to addressing psychological, social, and economic impacts, making\n\"safety\" a far more complex and interdisciplinary endeavor.\n\nFurthermore, the very definition of \"safety\" in the context of AI is\nundergoing a profound evolution. Historically, safety in engineering focused\non preventing physical harm, such as avoiding collisions in aviation or\nrobotics.15 However, the advent of AI systems introduces non-physical safety\nconcerns, including the generation of harmful content or the perpetuation of\nbiases.11 This expansion of the safety concept necessitates the development of\nnew, multi-dimensional safety metrics and assurance methods that can account\nfor qualitative, societal impacts. This requires a collaborative effort\nbetween engineers, ethicists, social scientists, and policymakers, and implies\nthat regulatory frameworks must be flexible enough to adapt to these evolving\ndefinitions of harm.\n\n## 2\\. Navigating Irresolvable Moral Dilemmas\n\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence into high-stakes autonomous systems\ninevitably confronts complex moral dilemmas, many of which appear irresolvable\nthrough conventional means. This section explores the philosophical\nunderpinnings of these challenges and examines practical manifestations in\ncritical domains.\n\n### The Philosophical Challenge: Beyond Benchmarking \"Ethicality\" to Value\nAlignment\n\nA significant challenge in AI ethics research is the current absence of\nestablished benchmarks or commonly accepted methods for quantitatively\nmeasuring an AI system's \"ethicality\".16 Drawing upon moral philosophy and\nmetaethics, some researchers argue that it is fundamentally impossible to\ndevelop such a universal benchmark. This impossibility stems from the inherent\nphilosophical complexities of \"ethics\" and the unambiguously relative nature\nof human values.16 Attempts to use philosophical thought experiments, such as\nthe classic \"trolley problem,\" as direct verification mechanisms for\nbenchmarking AI ethics are often deemed unsuitable, as their nuanced purpose\nis frequently misunderstood or misapplied by AI researchers.16\n\nConsequently, there is a growing consensus that it is more productive to\ndiscuss \"values\" and \"value alignment\" rather than \"ethics\" when considering\nthe potential actions of present and future AI systems. This shift in emphasis\nforces explicit consideration of what specific values are being aligned and,\ncrucially, whose values they are, thereby fostering greater conceptual clarity\nand transparency in AI research.16 This approach recognizes that AI ethics is\nnot a fixed, objective target to be programmed, but rather a dynamic, context-\ndependent negotiation of diverse human values. This necessitates a shift from\npurely philosophical or technical approaches to more participatory design\nprocesses and continuous societal dialogue to define acceptable value trade-\noffs. It shifts the burden from attempting to \"program ethics\" into AI to\ndesigning AI systems that are \"value-sensitive\" and adaptable to diverse human\nmoral landscapes, acknowledging that consensus on complex moral dilemmas is\noften elusive.\n\n### Case Study: Autonomous Vehicles and the \"Trolley Problem\"\n\nThe \"trolley problem\" serves as a quintessential thought experiment that\nencapsulates the profound ethical dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicle (AV)\ndesigners. These are situations where the AV cannot simultaneously fulfill its\nobligations to all road users and its passengers, forcing a choice with\npotentially fatal outcomes.17 AV manufacturers have largely rejected a purely\nutilitarian approach, which would involve explicitly programming the car to\ndecide \"who lives and who dies\" based on maximizing lives saved. Instead, they\nprioritize programming AVs for safety, often employing strategies like\nResponsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS), which aims to prevent collisions by\nmaintaining safe distances and adhering to traffic laws, assuming all road\nusers follow rules.17\n\nHowever, even without explicit \"trolley problem\" programming, an AV will\ninevitably behave in some way during an unavoidable collision scenario,\nwhether that behavior is consciously designed or emerges from its underlying\nrules.17 This highlights the unavoidable ethical dimension of even \"safety-\nfirst\" programming. Public perception reveals a critical disconnect: while\nmost study participants might prefer an AV to swerve to save a pedestrian,\nthey are significantly more likely to choose for the AV to stay on course and\nharm the pedestrian if they are a passenger in the AV. This phenomenon is\nattributed to a reduced sense of personal responsibility when control is\nperceived to be with the AI.18 This indicates a strong \"human element\" that\npotential users desire in AVs: a sensitivity to such ethical dilemmas,\nirrespective of their statistical rarity.18 This creates a profound and\npotentially debilitating trust gap. Manufacturers' pragmatic, safety-first\nengineering approach, while logically aimed at reducing overall accidents,\nfails to address the public's deep-seated ethical anxieties about AI's \"moral\nagency\" in unavoidable, life-or-death situations. This disconnect can severely\nimpede the widespread adoption of AVs, even if they are statistically proven\nto be safer than human-driven vehicles. The \"first failure effect\" further\nexacerbates this, demonstrating how a single, ethically charged incident can\ndisproportionately erode public trust, regardless of the overall safety\nrecord, if transparency and clear ethical principles are not communicated.12\n\n### Case Study: Autonomous Surgical Robots and Human Judgment\n\nThe integration of AI into surgical practice presents substantial ethical\ncomplexities, particularly concerning its impact on surgeon autonomy, the\nultimate authority of human medical professionals, and the nuanced patient-\ndoctor relationship.5 Unlike human practitioners, AI systems inherently lack\nthe capacity for moral reflection, ethical judgment, and the integration of\ninherently human factors such as emotions, cultural contexts, moral beliefs,\nand personal experiences into decision-making.5\n\nA central ethical challenge is determining accountability and liability when\nan AI-driven system contributes to a medical error or an adverse patient\noutcome. This fundamentally challenges traditional medical malpractice\nframeworks that are predicated on the concept of human agency.6 The \"black box\neffect,\" where AI algorithms produce recommendations without transparent\nexplanations, severely undermines accountability and erodes public and\nprofessional trust. This necessitates the development and adoption of\nExplainable AI (XAI) to ensure clinicians can understand and validate AI-\ndriven recommendations before acting upon them.6 The overarching objective is\nto develop ethical frameworks where AI functions as a complementary tool that\nenhances human decision-making in surgery, rather than infringing upon the\ndeeply embedded ethical principles of human judgment and experience. This\nentails a careful balance, ensuring AI does not autonomously make decisions\nthat require human ethical discernment.5 The increasing automation in robot-\nassisted surgery (RAS) inevitably raises a broad spectrum of new ethical and\nsocial questions related to potential harms and benefits, the distribution of\nresponsibility and control, and the evolving nature of the professional-\npatient relationship.20\n\nIn the domain of robotic care assistants, the development and widespread\ndissemination face significant hurdles due to the current lack of clear\ndefinitions, standardized product classifications, and universally accepted\nsafety standards.21 Ethical dilemmas in this domain include the risk of\nalgorithmic bias leading to discrimination against vulnerable populations; for\nexample, an AI recruiting tool that penalized women or a system that wrongly\naccused families of fraud based on factors like dual nationality and low\nincome.22 Complex questions also arise regarding the authorship and copyright\nof AI-generated content.22 Public surveys indicate a notable lack of\nacceptance for robots in the direct care of children, the elderly, and the\ndisabled, despite the demographic imperative for increased care support.23\n\nThis demonstrates a fundamental tension between AI autonomy and human\naccountability. As AI systems gain more functional autonomy, the potential for\n\"responsibility gaps\" widens.20 This is not merely a legal or technical\nchallenge but a fundamental ethical one: how can society leverage AI's\nimpressive precision and efficiency without eroding the indispensable human\nelement of moral discernment, ultimate responsibility, and accountability,\nespecially in life-or-death scenarios? The solution points towards a necessary\nembrace of \"human-in-the-loop\" and \"deliberative AI\" paradigms as crucial\nmechanisms. These approaches aim to maintain human agency and accountability\nby ensuring that AI functions as a supportive tool that augments, rather than\nreplaces, human ethical judgment and ultimate decision-making authority.\n\n### Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks for AI\n\nTranslating abstract ethical principles into concrete AI systems involves\nvarious approaches:\n\n  * Top-down methods involve explicitly programming ethical rules and decision procedures directly into AI systems, famously exemplified by Isaac Asimov's \"Three Laws of Robotics\".24 While offering explicit definitions of values and cost-effectiveness through automated fine-tuning, their weaknesses include simplicity, lack of flexibility, and an inability to dynamically adapt to diverse user needs or preferences.24\n\n  * Bottom-up approaches aim for AI systems to learn ethical behavior by inferring moral preferences entirely from human behavior or text data, without a pre-specified moral framework.24\n\n  * Hybrid approaches combine elements of both, employing machine learning within a broader framework of ethical constraints and goals defined by humans.25\n\nA more recent and prominent hybrid approach is Constitutional AI (CAI). This\nmethod defines a \"constitution\" of feedback Large Language Models (LLMs) that\nare explicitly prompted to embody specific principles, such as ethical, moral,\nand non-toxic behavior.24 CAI offers greater transparency and control over the\nvalues being instilled compared to opaque reward modeling.24 An extension,\nCollective Constitutional AI, further aims to generate more generally or\npluralistically aligned agents by incorporating crowd-sourced constitutional\nprinciples.3 However, a challenge remains in scaling CAI to efficiently align\nsystems with the diverse values of a broad range of human users, as it still\nrelies on feedback from very large and advanced LLMs.24\n\nThe role of Deliberative AI and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) systems is becoming\nincreasingly critical. Deliberative AI represents an advancement that\nleverages LLMs to facilitate flexible conversational interactions and provide\nfaithful information. This enables humans and AI to engage in thoughtful,\nreasoned discussions about conflicting opinions, evidence, and arguments,\nallowing for dynamic updates to their perspectives and decisions.26\nExploratory evaluations suggest that Deliberative AI can outperform\nconventional Explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving appropriate human\nreliance and overall task performance, particularly in challenging\nscenarios.26\n\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL) decision-making directly integrates human expertise\nwith AI algorithms. In HITL systems, AI provides recommendations or\npredictions that a human decision-maker then evaluates, corrects, approves, or\nrejects.27 This blended approach offers several advantages: it improves\naccuracy by incorporating human judgment, increases transparency in decision-\nmaking processes, and ensures that ethical and moral considerations are\nexplicitly taken into account.27 Human oversight is paramount in HITL systems\nto ensure that AI remains ethical, accurate, and aligned with organizational\nobjectives. This is especially critical given that AI excels at repetitive\ntasks without error, while humans excel at establishing context, creative\nproblem-solving, and ethical reasoning.28 The appropriate level of human\ncontrol is highly dependent on the specific context and the stakes involved.\nFor high-stakes systems, maintaining \"meaningful human control\" is essential,\nensuring humans can intervene and override AI decisions when necessary.25\n\nTable 1: Comparison of Ethical Frameworks in AI Decision-Making\n\n  \n\nFramework| Core Principle| How AI Might Apply It| Strengths in AI Context|\nWeaknesses/Challenges in AI Context| Relevant Snippets  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nUtilitarianism| Maximize overall well-being/happiness for the greatest\nnumber.| An autonomous vehicle might choose to hit one person to save five.|\nAims for optimal societal outcomes; quantifiable (e.g., lives saved).|\nRequires AI to \"weigh\" lives, which is ethically problematic and practically\nimpossible; can neglect individual rights or minority groups.| 17  \nDeontological Ethics| Follow moral rules and duties regardless of\nconsequences.| An AI might always prioritize protecting its passengers,\nadhering to a pre-programmed rule.| Provides clear, consistent rules;\nemphasizes duties and rights; avoids complex outcome predictions.| Can lead to\noutcomes that seem counter-intuitive or suboptimal in specific scenarios\n(e.g., sacrificing more lives to uphold a rule); difficulty in defining\nuniversal, non-conflicting rules.| 25  \nVirtue Ethics| Cultivate moral character traits (e.g., compassion, wisdom).|\nAn AI doctor might be designed to embody empathy and beneficence in patient\ninteractions.| Focuses on the character of the AI's operation rather than just\nrules or outcomes; adaptable to nuanced situations.| Highly abstract and\ndifficult to operationalize or \"program\" into an algorithm; subjective\ninterpretation of virtues.| 25  \n  \n## 3\\. Ensuring Robust Validation and Safety\n\nThe safe and reliable deployment of high-stakes autonomous AI systems hinges\non robust validation and comprehensive safety measures. This section delves\ninto the principles of robust AI, addresses systemic risks, and outlines\nevolving regulatory frameworks and advanced validation methodologies.\n\n### Principles of Robust AI: Fault Tolerance, Error Resilience, and\nReliability\n\nRobust Artificial Intelligence (Robust AI) is defined as the capability of AI\nsystems to consistently maintain their performance and reliability even in the\npresence of internal and external system errors, malicious inputs (such as\nadversarial attacks and data poisoning), and dynamic changes to the data or\noperational environment.9 The core design philosophy for robust AI systems\nemphasizes fault tolerance and error resilience, ensuring they can function\neffectively despite variations and errors within their operational\nenvironments.9 Achieving Robust AI necessitates the implementation of\ncomprehensive strategies for fault detection, effective mitigation of\nidentified issues, and rapid recovery mechanisms. Furthermore, resilience must\nbe prioritized and integrated throughout the entire AI development lifecycle,\nfrom conception to deployment and ongoing operation.9\n\n### Addressing Systemic Risks and Failure Modes\n\nCommon hazards in robot applications are multifaceted, encompassing human\nerrors during integration or programming, such as misinterpreting robot\nmovement, incorrect control activation, or over-familiarity leading to\nhazardous positioning.29 Control system errors, including software faults and\nelectromagnetic interference, can cause dangerous, unpredicted movements.\nOther risks include unauthorized access to restricted spaces, cumulative\nmechanical failures not accounted for in operating programs, operational\npressures leading to overlooked safety steps, and adverse environmental\nconditions like exposure to water, heat, dust, or flammable atmospheres.29\n\nTo mitigate these hazards, various safeguarding devices are employed. These\ninclude presence-sensing devices (e.g., light curtains), fixed\nbarrier/perimeter guards, interlocked barrier guards, mechanical and non-\nmechanical limiting devices, awareness devices (e.g., signs, horns), enabling\ndevices, lockout/tagout procedures, speed and separation monitoring, hand-\nguided controls, and power/force limiting mechanisms.29 For specialized\napplications like care robots, specific safety standards address critical\naspects such as electrical safety (e.g., battery integrity, emergency stops),\nmechanical safety (e.g., preventing pinching or squeezing), the presence of\nhazardous substances, and acceptable noise levels.21 AI systems introduce\nnovel failure modes and exhibit an inherent dependence on their training data\nand methods, directly linking their reliability to data quality and\nrepresentativeness.14 The behavior of AI systems can be inherently\nunpredictable due to their continuous learning from and adaptation to data\nthat may change over time.11\n\n### Evolving Regulatory Frameworks for AI Safety\n\nRecognizing the escalating risks, regulatory bodies worldwide are developing\nframeworks to ensure AI safety.\n\nThe DHS Framework for Critical Infrastructure in the U.S. has introduced a\n\"Roles and Responsibilities Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Critical\nInfrastructure\" to guide the safe and secure deployment of AI across vital\nsectors.4 This framework emphasizes risk-based mitigations, fostering\ntransparency, and promoting information sharing among all stakeholders in the\nAI supply chain.4 Key recommendations include establishing secure operational\nenvironments, driving responsible AI model design, implementing robust data\ngovernance, ensuring safe and secure deployment practices, and continuously\nmonitoring performance and impact.4 AI developers are specifically urged to\nprioritize safety and resilience from the foundational design phase,\nintegrating fail-safes, conducting rigorous stress tests, and simulating\npotential failure scenarios.30 The framework also advocates for the adoption\nof explainable AI practices to enhance transparency and provide auditable\ntrails, alongside promoting extensive collaboration between public and private\nsectors.30\n\nThe EU AI Act and ISO 42001 represent a risk-based governance approach. The EU\nAI Act is the first comprehensive legal framework globally, classifying AI\nsystems by their risk level and imposing stringent controls on \"high-risk\"\napplications, which include those in critical infrastructure, medical devices,\nand autonomous vehicles.2 High-risk AI systems are subject to demanding legal\nobligations, including mandatory conformity assessments, human oversight\nprotocols, granular data governance, robust cybersecurity measures,\nexplainability requirements, and both pre- and post-market monitoring.2\nISO/IEC 42001, released in 2023, is the first international standard for AI\nmanagement systems. It provides a structured, risk-based approach to\nresponsibly govern, develop, and deploy AI across diverse use cases and\nindustries, promoting both innovation and accountability.2 A central focus of\nISO 42001 is the identification, assessment, and mitigation of AI-specific\nrisks, encompassing potential biases in training data, limitations in\nexplainability, robustness concerns, privacy issues, and broader societal\nimpacts.33 The standard mandates meaningful human oversight proportional to\nthe identified risk level and requires continuous validation of AI systems\nthroughout their entire lifecycle.33\n\nThe NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) offers comprehensive guidelines\nfor organizations to effectively identify, assess, and mitigate AI-related\nrisks, thereby enhancing trust and ensuring responsible AI development and\ndeployment.34 Its core functions\u2014Map, Measure, Manage, and Govern\u2014are designed\nto cultivate trustworthy, transparent, and ethical AI systems.34 The AI RMF\nexplicitly advocates for key trustworthiness characteristics: transparency\n(clear understanding of AI processes), accountability (responsibility for AI\noutcomes), ethical considerations (aligning AI practices with societal\nvalues), bias mitigation, data privacy, and real-time monitoring.34 The\n\"Measure\" function, in particular, emphasizes the identification and\napplication of appropriate methods and metrics, regular assessment of their\nefficacy, involvement of internal and independent experts in evaluations,\ncomprehensive assessment of AI systems for all trustworthy characteristics\n(validity, reliability, safety, security, fairness, privacy, explainability),\nand continuous tracking of identified risks over time.14\n\nThese frameworks highlight a systemic barrier to trust and accountability: the\n\"black box\" problem. Multiple sources consistently identify the \"black box\neffect\"\u2014where AI decisions are made without clear, human-understandable\nexplanations\u2014as a critical issue.1 This opacity is directly linked to\nundermining accountability 6, eroding public and professional trust 10, and\ncomplicating effective post-incident analysis.31 The inability to explain why\nan AI made a certain decision prevents proper blame assignment or learning\nfrom failures, creating a \"responsibility gap\".20 This indicates that the lack\nof explainability is not merely a technical inconvenience but a fundamental\nimpediment to the ethical governance and societal acceptance of high-stakes\nAI. It creates a critical barrier to establishing clear lines of\nresponsibility and to fostering the necessary confidence for widespread\nadoption. This directly drives the imperative for Explainable AI (XAI) 6 and\nrobust audit trails 31 as non-negotiable requirements, moving beyond mere\nperformance metrics to focus on transparency and interpretability by design.\n\nTable 2: Overview of Major AI Governance Frameworks\n\nFramework Name| Governing Body/Origin| Key Principles/Focus Areas| Risk\nClassification Approach| Key Requirements for High-Stakes Systems| Current\nStatus/Applicability  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nDHS Framework for AI in Critical Infrastructure| U.S. Department of Homeland\nSecurity (DHS)| Risk-based mitigations, transparency, information sharing,\nresponsible model design, data governance, secure deployment, performance\nmonitoring.| Categorizes risks by scale and severity (e.g., operational,\nsystemic, cross-sector).| Secure environments, risk-based access to models,\nvalidate AI use, vulnerability reporting, meaningful transparency, real-world\nrisk evaluation, independent assessments.| U.S. critical infrastructure\nsectors; non-binding but influential.  \nEU AI Act| European Union (EU)| Safety, transparency, traceability, non-\ndiscrimination, human oversight, environmental friendliness.| Risk-based:\nUnacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal.

This is primarily due to their\ninherent non-deterministic behavior, high complexity, and often opaque\nreasoning processes.1 This complexity significantly complicates the\nverification of reliability and the establishment of \"suitability proof,\"\nmaking it difficult to apply traditional formal verification methods.38 The\nIEC 61508:2010 standard, a cornerstone for functional safety, is currently\ninterpreted as not recommending the direct use of AI methods within safety-\nrelated systems. Solutions often involve a \"functional decomposition\"\napproach, where a conventional, deterministic monitor oversees the AI-based\ncomponent.38 New concepts like AI-SIL (Safety Integrity Levels for Artificial\nIntelligence) and ASL (AI Safety Levels) are actively being developed to\nbridge this gap.38 Assuring safety integrity for learned systems is further\nchallenged by the difficulty in adequately predicting and assuring all\npossible behaviors, particularly in novel or unforeseen scenarios.39\n\nThis signifies a profound paradigm shift from a one-time, static\n\"certification\" model to a continuous, dynamic \"assurance\" model for AI\nsafety. Because AI systems can \"drift\" and exhibit emergent behaviors that\nwere not present during initial development, safety cannot be guaranteed\nsolely at design time.2 This necessitates ongoing validation, real-time\nmonitoring, and adaptive regulatory approaches throughout the entire AI\nlifecycle, including post-deployment performance tracking, rapid incident\nresponse, and continuous re-evaluation of risk tolerances.\n\n#### Engineering-Grade Security and Assurance Frameworks\n\nEnsuring the safe and reliable operation of large-scale autonomous AI models\nnecessitates the implementation of robust, engineering-grade security and\nassurance frameworks.31 This involves establishing a unified pipeline that\nintegrates standardized threat metrics, advanced adversarial hardening\ntechniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the\ndevelopment lifecycle.31 Key techniques include design-time risk assessments\n(e.g., Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), ISO 31000 risk management),\nsecure training protocols (e.g., differential privacy, secure multiparty\ncomputation), and continuous monitoring with automated audit logging.31\nAdversarial hardening, through practices like red-teaming and adversarial\ntraining loops, is crucial for building resilience against input\nperturbations, data poisoning, and model extraction attempts, thereby\ndelivering provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and\noperational stress.31\n\n#### Explainable AI (XAI), Audit Logging, and Data Provenance Transparency for\nPost-Incident Analysis\n\nTransparency tools, including Explainable AI (XAI), comprehensive audit logs,\nand robust data provenance tracking, are indispensable for ensuring policy\ncompliance, facilitating ethical review, and enabling effective post-incident\nanalysis.22 XAI aims to provide interpretable decision-making models,\nclarifying how or why an AI system arrived at a particular output. This is\nespecially critical in high-stakes fields like emergency surgery, where\nclinicians must rapidly understand and validate AI recommendations.6 Automated\naudit logging and the maintenance of immutable audit trails for datasets and\nmodel artifacts (potentially via technologies like blockchain registries or\ncryptographic hashing) are essential for forensic tracing, supporting\naccountability, and enabling detailed post-incident investigations.25 Data\nprovenance transparency ensures the complete traceability of model inputs and\noutputs, which is vital for regulatory compliance and verifying the integrity\nof AI systems.31 Continuous monitoring of AI systems in production\nenvironments is crucial to detect \"drift\" (changes in data distribution or\nmodel behavior) and ensure that systems continue to meet their original design\nassumptions and performance criteria over time.14\n\nA significant challenge in AI validation is the dual problem of data quality\nand bias. AI models are data-driven and can inherit biases embedded in raw\ndata, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.11 The \"data quality gap\"\nin surgical AI, where non-standardized or unrepresentative data directly\nresults in biased or non-generalizable predictions, exemplifies this.6 The\nNIST AI RMF explicitly mandates assessing data quality, ensuring diverse\nsourcing, and implementing strategies for bias mitigation.14 This highlights a\ndirect causal link: poor data quality and inherent biases in training data are\nnot merely technical imperfections but fundamental flaws that directly\ntranslate into unreliable, unfair, and potentially harmful AI system\nperformance, even if the underlying algorithms are technically sound. This\nmeans that robust validation must extend significantly beyond algorithmic\ncorrectness to include rigorous data governance, comprehensive bias detection,\nand continuous mitigation strategies throughout the entire data lifecycle. It\nunderscores that \"safe\" AI is inextricably linked to \"fair\" AI, and that\naddressing bias is a prerequisite for trustworthiness and ethical deployment.\n\nTable 3: Key Components of Robust AI and Validation Methodologies\n\n  \n\nComponent/Methodology| Description| Purpose in Achieving Robust AI|\nExamples/Specific Techniques| Relevant Snippets  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFault Tolerance & Error Resilience| Ability of AI systems to maintain\nperformance despite internal/external errors, malicious inputs, environmental\nshifts.| Sustained operation and reliability in unpredictable real-world\nenvironments.| Error detection/correction codes, redundancy (DMR, TMR),\ncheckpoint/restart, built-in self-test (BIST), failover mechanisms.| 9  \nRisk Assessment & Mitigation| Proactive identification, analysis, and\ntreatment of potential hazards throughout the AI lifecycle.| Minimize\nlikelihood and severity of adverse outcomes; integrate safety from design.|\nFailure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), ISO 31000, stress testing,\nsimulating failure scenarios, red-teaming, adversarial training.| 30  \nData Governance & Quality Assurance| Processes to manage data lifecycle,\nensuring data quality, representativeness, privacy, and security.| Mitigate\nalgorithmic bias, improve generalizability, ensure fair and reliable AI\noutputs.| Diverse data sourcing, rigorous validation, continuous monitoring\nfor data drift, privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), consent frameworks.| 6  \nExplainable AI (XAI)| Techniques to make AI decisions interpretable and\nunderstandable to humans.| Foster trust, enable accountability, facilitate\nethical review, support human oversight, aid post-incident analysis.| Visual\nheatmaps, logical flow diagrams, probabilistic reasoning layers, saliency\nmaps, feature attributions.| 6  \nAudit Logging & Data Provenance| Maintaining immutable, traceable records of\nAI inputs, processes, decisions, and outputs.| Ensure transparency, support\naccountability, enable forensic analysis for incidents, verify system\nintegrity.| Blockchain registries, cryptographic hashing,\nwatermarking/fingerprinting, automated audit logs.| 25  \nContinuous Monitoring & Validation| Ongoing assessment of AI system\nperformance and behavior in production environments.| Detect emergent risks,\nadapt to changing conditions, ensure sustained trustworthiness and safety.|\nReal-time anomaly detection, tracking performance metrics (accuracy, bias,\nexplainability), comparing production vs. pre-deployment data, collecting\noperational use cases.| 14  \n  \n## 4\\. Cultivating Public Trust for Safe Deployment\n\nThe successful and widespread adoption of high-stakes autonomous systems is\ninextricably linked to the cultivation and maintenance of public trust. This\ntrust is not automatically granted but must be actively earned through\ntransparent practices, demonstrable accountability, and effective\ncommunication.\n\n### Foundations of Trust: Transparency, Accountability, and Fairness\n\nPublic trust is recognized as an indispensable element for achieving\nwidespread public acceptance and ensuring the safe and responsible deployment\nof AI systems.12 The core principles underpinning trustworthy AI include\nfairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and general acceptance\nby users and stakeholders.34\n\nTransparency, particularly in how AI systems operate and make decisions, is\ncrucial, especially given the inherent complexity and \"black box\" nature of\nmany AI algorithms.19 This also extends to clearly disclosing when content has\nbeen generated by AI.32 Accountability entails ensuring that AI systems, along\nwith their creators and managers, are demonstrably responsible and responsive\nto their outcomes and impacts, with clear processes established for redress in\ncases of harm.22 Fairness in AI is defined as the consistent production of\nunbiased outcomes, ensuring no favoritism or discrimination, and proactively\nimplementing measures to prevent potential bias issues from manifesting.22\n\n### The Critical Role of Human Oversight and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Systems\n\nHuman oversight is a fundamental and necessary component, particularly during\nthe early stages of AI deployment and in high-stakes contexts. It serves as an\nessential additional layer of safety and acts as a crucial safeguard against\nexcessive reliance on automation.33 Maintaining \"meaningful human control\" is\nparamount, ensuring that human operators retain the ability to intervene in\nand override AI decisions, especially when confronting high-stakes choices or\nunforeseen circumstances.25\n\nVarying levels of autonomy, ranging from A0 (No Autonomy) to A5 (Full\nAutonomy), define the corresponding degree of human intervention, the\nnecessary level of oversight, and the decision-making authority granted to the\nAI system.48 Even at the highest level of autonomy (A5), minimal human\ninvolvement is still anticipated for strategic decisions, monitoring, and\naddressing rare, highly complex situations.48 In critical systems such as\nautonomous flight, human operators, often referred to as Remote Pilot in\nCommand (RPIC), are required to continuously monitor environmental conditions,\nevaluate AI-generated suggestions, and approve or reject them based on their\nsituational awareness and expert judgment.47 The \"Human-in-the-Loop\" (HITL)\napproach is critical for ensuring that AI systems operate effectively in real-\nworld contexts where human intuition, expertise, creativity, and ethical\nreasoning are indispensable.28\n\nTable 4: Levels of Autonomy and Corresponding Human Oversight/Responsibility\n\n  \n\nAutonomy Level| Description of System Capability| Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\nRequirement| Human Role in Output/Decision-making| Human Monitoring Role|\nPrimary Responsibility/Liability| Relevant Snippets  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nA0: No Autonomy| Human-only system.| Not Applicable (Human-only)| Human\nOperator produces final output.| Human Operator MUST monitor.| Operator /\nDeployer| 48  \nA1: Assisted Operation| Machines SHOULD assist, MUST NOT confirm.| Humans MAY\nassist, MUST confirm.| Human Operator produces final output.| Human Operator\nMUST monitor.| Operator / Deployer| 48  \nA2: Partial Autonomy| Machines MAY assist, MAY confirm.| Humans MAY assist,\nMUST confirm.| Human Operator MUST confirm output.| Human Operator MUST\nmonitor.| Operator / Deployer| 48  \nA3: Conditional Autonomy| System manages most tasks under well-defined\nconditions; human ready to intervene if requested.| Machines MAY assist, MAY\nconfirm.| Human Operator SHOULD intervene to correct if requested.| Human\nOperator MUST monitor.| Operator/Developer / Deployer| 48  \nA4: High Autonomy| System performs end-to-end processes autonomously within\nspecific contexts; human intervention only for outside predefined conditions.|\nMachines MAY assist, MAY confirm.| Human Operator MAY intervene to correct\nbased on environmental change.| Human Operator MUST monitor.|\nDeveloper/Deployer| 48  \nA5: Full Autonomy| System capable of handling all tasks across various\nenvironments without constant human oversight.| Machines MAY assist, SHOULD\nconfirm.| Human Operator MAY intervene to correct based on environmental\nchange.| Human Operator MAY monitor.| Deployer| 48  \n  \n### Public Engagement and Communication Strategies\n\nActively engaging the public in discussions about AI ethics and maintaining\nunwavering transparency throughout the AI development process are crucial\nstrategies for building and sustaining trust.45 These efforts help to\ndemystify complex AI technologies, making them more understandable, and\nprovide essential platforms for stakeholders to voice their concerns and\nexpectations.45 Leading autonomous vehicle companies, such as Aurora,\nproactively engage with government leaders, regulators, first responders, and\nlocal communities through extensive meetings, legislative testimonies, and\nspecialized training programs. This collaborative approach aims to build trust\nand ensure transparent communication well in advance of self-driving\noperations.49\n\nPublic distrust can significantly impede the adoption of AI, with safety\nconcerns and a fundamental lack of trust identified as primary inhibitors.12\nHigh-profile incidents, such as the 2018 Uber AV crash or General Motors'\nCruise Division's misreporting of a subsequent incident in 2023, dramatically\nerode public trust, illustrating a powerful \"first failure effect\".12 To\nrebuild trust after such incidents, complete transparency about the causes of\ncrashes and the specific safety improvements being implemented is vital.12\nConversely, misreporting or omitting critical information exacerbates public\nscrutiny and leads to a greater, more prolonged loss of trust.12 The media\nplays a pivotal role in shaping public perception, and its portrayal of AI\nincidents can amplify fear and skepticism. Therefore, policymakers and\nmanufacturers must actively collaborate with media outlets to ensure balanced\nnarratives and accurate public education.12 This highlights the extreme\nfragility of public trust in nascent, high-stakes AI technologies. A single,\nwell-publicized incident, if mishandled in terms of transparency and\ncommunication, can have far-reaching and disproportionately negative impacts\non public acceptance and adoption rates. This underscores the critical need\nfor proactive, honest, and comprehensive communication strategies from AI\ndevelopers and policymakers, shifting away from defensive or adversarial\nstances towards open collaboration with media and the public. Trust, in this\ncontext, is built not just on technical performance but on consistent,\ntruthful, and empathetic engagement, especially when things go wrong.\n\nDemystifying AI and fostering informed acceptance involves providing\naccessible technical and educational resources, including workshops, open\neducational materials, and interactive simulators. These initiatives are vital\nfor equipping the public with foundational AI knowledge, enabling informed\nscrutiny, promoting critical thinking, and fostering accountability.3\nFacilitating broader public participation through accessible interfaces (e.g.,\nreal-time translations, interactive dashboards) and structured feedback/co-\ncreation sessions enables non-experts to contribute valuable insights into\nmodel objectives and flagged decisions.3 Formalizing community assemblies,\nsuch as local AI councils with advisory or even decision-making roles, can\nensure meaningful public influence on AI-driven processes and prevent ethical\nor societal oversights.3 Establishing community-based data trusts and\ntransparent auditing processes (accessible to both laypersons and experts)\nenhances accountability and prevents unchecked data abuses, contributing to\noverall public confidence.3\n\n### Factors Influencing Trust and Acceptance\n\nResearch indicates that consumer attitudes toward technology, their general\ntechnology use, and inherent personality traits are the primary drivers of\ntrust and intention to use AI in healthcare, often more so than the specific\nhealthcare use cases themselves.50 Self-evaluated AI knowledge exhibits an\ninverted U-shaped relationship with attitudes: both individuals with very low\nand very high self-evaluated knowledge about AI tend to show more negative\nattitudes. Novices may be hesitant due to unfamiliarity, while experts might\nbe more critically disposed due to a deeper awareness of risks and\nlimitations.50 This suggests that public education and engagement strategies\nfor AI need to be far more nuanced and targeted than simply disseminating more\ninformation. A blanket approach might be ineffective or even\ncounterproductive. Communication efforts must balance demystification with\nrealistic expectations, openly acknowledging the complexities, inherent\nlimitations, and residual risks that experts understand. The focus should\nshift to how these risks are managed, how human values are integrated, and how\nhuman oversight is maintained, rather than solely emphasizing technical\ncapabilities. This requires segmenting audiences and tailoring messages to\naddress specific concerns and knowledge gaps at different levels of\nunderstanding.\n\nDemographic factors, such as gender and age, also play a significant, often\nnon-linear and interacting role in shaping perceptions. Women generally appear\nmore cautious about AI in healthcare than men, and older individuals tend to\nbe more reserved, although those over 70 may show a greater willingness to\nshare data for healthcare benefits due to acute needs.50 An individual's\nexisting opinion on current healthcare services can also influence their\nattitudes toward AI integration in healthcare.50\n\nThere is a critical psychological phenomenon observed regarding control and\nresponsibility in public trust. As passengers in autonomous vehicles (AVs),\nindividuals feel less direct control over the vehicle's actions. This reduced\nsense of control leads them to be more willing to attribute responsibility for\nharmful outcomes to the AV itself, and consequently, they are more likely to\nprefer the AV harm a pedestrian over themselves in a dilemma. This contrasts\nsharply with their moral choices when they perceive themselves as the\ndriver.18 This suggests a fundamental psychological barrier to cultivating\npublic trust in highly autonomous systems: the desire to offload moral\nresponsibility onto the machine. While this might seem beneficial for the\nindividual user (reducing their perceived culpability), it creates a profound\ncollective societal challenge. The public simultaneously demands ethical\nbehavior from AI (e.g., protecting pedestrians) but may not accept the\npersonal risks or moral burden associated with such ethical programming. This\nparadox complicates the design of \"ethical\" AI, as aligning with individual\nself-preservation might conflict with broader societal values. Effective\ncommunication strategies must therefore address this complex psychological\ndimension, moving beyond mere technical facts to explore shared responsibility\nand the implications of delegating moral choices to machines.\n\nTable 5: Factors Influencing Public Trust in AI\n\n  \n\nFactor Category| Specific Factors| Impact on Trust| Relevant Snippets  \n---|---|---|---  \nPerceived Attributes of AI| Transparency (clear operations, AI-generated\ncontent disclosure)| Positive: Increases confidence; Negative: Black box\neffect erodes trust.| 19  \n  \n| Accountability (responsibility for outcomes, redress mechanisms)| Positive:\nFosters confidence in redress; Negative: Responsibility gaps undermine trust.|\n22  \n  \n| Fairness (unbiased outcomes, non-discrimination)| Positive: Essential for\nequitable treatment; Negative: Algorithmic bias erodes trust and can lead to\nharm.| 22  \n  \n| Explainability (understandable decision-making)| Positive: Builds\nunderstanding and validation; Negative: \"Black box\" effect reduces trust.| 6  \n  \n| Reliability (consistent, predictable performance)| Positive: Core to\nfunctional trust; Negative: Unpredictability leads to skepticism.| 9  \nHuman Characteristics| AI Knowledge (self-evaluated)| Complex/Non-linear:\nInverted U-shape (low/high knowledge associated with more negative\nattitudes).| 50  \n  \n| Personality Traits (e.g., disorganized, anxious, reserved)| Complex:\nSpecific traits correlate with higher or lower trust/acceptance.| 50  \n  \n| Gender| Complex: Women often more cautious than men, with variations by use\ncase.| 50  \n  \n| Age| Complex: Older individuals often more reserved, but those over 70 may\naccept trade-offs more.| 50  \n  \n| Perceived Control & Responsibility| Complex: Lower perceived control (e.g.,\nAV passenger) can lead to different moral choices and responsibility\nattribution to AI.| 18  \n  \n| Opinion on Current Services (e.g., healthcare)| Positive: Positive views on\nexisting services correlate with positive AI attitudes.| 50  \nExternal Factors| Media Portrayal| Negative: Amplifies fear and skepticism,\nespecially after incidents.| 12  \n  \n| Previous Incidents / \"First Failure Effect\"| Negative: Single, high-profile\nincidents dramatically erode trust, especially if mishandled.| 12  \n  \n| Communication Strategies (proactive, transparent)| Positive: Builds and\nrebuilds trust, demystifies technology.| 12  \n  \n| Participatory Governance (e.g., local AI councils)| Positive: Empowers\npublic, fosters communal stewardship.| 3  \n  \n## 5\\. Recommendations for Responsible AI Deployment\n\nThe safe and beneficial deployment of high-stakes autonomous AI systems\nrequires a concerted, multi-faceted approach that integrates policy, technical\ndevelopment, and societal engagement. The following recommendations are\nderived from the preceding analysis.\n\n### Policy and Governance Recommendations\n\n  * Shift from \"Ethics\" to \"Value Alignment\": Policymakers should proactively establish and promote frameworks that prioritize explicit value alignment in AI design. This involves clearly defining whose values are being prioritized and how trade-offs are managed, rather than pursuing the unachievable goal of benchmarking a universal \"ethicality\".16 This approach acknowledges the inherent relativity of human values and fosters more transparent and context-sensitive development.\n\n  * Harmonized Risk-Based Regulation: Advocate for the adoption and international harmonization of comprehensive, risk-based regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO 42001. This ensures consistent standards for safety, transparency, accountability, and human oversight across diverse jurisdictions, facilitating global deployment while mitigating risks.2 Such harmonization is crucial for avoiding regulatory fragmentation and fostering innovation responsibly.\n\n  * Clear Accountability and Liability Frameworks: Develop forward-looking legal frameworks that precisely delineate human versus machine responsibility for AI-driven errors and adverse outcomes. This may involve exploring innovative hybrid liability models that distribute responsibility among developers, deployers, and human operators, ensuring no \"responsibility gap\" exists.6 Clarity in this area is essential for justice and for incentivizing responsible development.\n\n  * Mandatory Explainability and Auditability: Implement mandatory requirements for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, automated audit logging, and data provenance tracking for all high-stakes AI systems. These measures are essential to ensure transparency in AI decision-making, facilitate thorough post-incident analysis, and enable clear accountability.6 Such requirements move beyond mere performance to address the fundamental need for understanding and trust.\n\n  * Promote Public-Private Collaboration: Foster robust collaboration among government bodies, industry leaders, academic institutions, and civil society organizations. This collective effort is vital for sharing best practices, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, and co-developing comprehensive AI safety and ethical standards.3 Collaborative ecosystems accelerate learning and adaptation to new challenges.\n\n### Technical Development Best Practices\n\n  * Design for Robustness and Resilience: Embed principles of fault tolerance, error resilience, and security-by-design throughout the entire AI development lifecycle. This includes rigorous stress testing, advanced adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection capabilities to ensure systems perform reliably under diverse and challenging conditions.9 Proactive security and resilience measures are critical to prevent failures in unpredictable real-world scenarios.\n\n  * Prioritize Data Quality and Diversity: Ensure that training datasets are not only extensive but also diverse, inclusive, and truly representative of the intended operational environment and user populations. This is critical for mitigating algorithmic bias and improving the generalizability and fairness of AI models.6 Implement rigorous data governance and continuous monitoring for data drift to maintain model integrity.14 Addressing data quality and bias at the source is fundamental to ethical AI.\n\n  * Implement Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) and Deliberative AI: Design AI systems that actively incorporate and maintain meaningful human oversight, allowing for human intervention and override, particularly in complex, ambiguous, or ethically fraught scenarios.25 Develop and integrate \"Deliberative AI\" capabilities to foster constructive human-AI dialogue, enabling joint refinement of decisions and resolution of conflicting opinions.26 This ensures that human ethical judgment remains central.\n\n  * Continuous Validation and Monitoring: Shift the focus from one-time certification to a continuous assurance paradigm. Implement ongoing evaluation of AI performance in real-world production environments to proactively detect emergent risks, adapt to changing conditions, and ensure sustained trustworthiness and safety throughout the system's operational lifespan.14 This dynamic approach is essential for systems that learn and adapt post-deployment.\n\n### Societal Engagement and Education Initiatives\n\n  * Proactive and Transparent Communication: AI developers and deployers must commit to open, honest, and proactive communication with the public, especially in the aftermath of incidents. This is crucial for building and rebuilding trust, counteracting the \"first failure effect,\" and demonstrating a commitment to public safety over corporate reputation.12 Any form of misreporting or omission of critical information must be avoided.12\n\n  * Demystify AI through Education: Invest in and provide accessible technical and educational resources, such as workshops, open educational materials, and interactive simulators. These initiatives are vital for equipping the public with foundational AI knowledge, enabling informed scrutiny, promoting critical thinking, and fostering accountability.3\n\n  * Facilitate Participatory Governance: Actively establish and support mechanisms for participatory governance, including local AI councils, community assemblies, and community-based data trusts. These structures enable broader public engagement and direct influence on AI design, development, and governance, fostering communal stewardship and reconciling it with intellectual property rights.3\n\n  * Address Psychological Factors of Trust: Develop communication strategies that are nuanced and tailored to account for the complex psychological factors influencing public trust. This includes addressing perceived control, responsibility attribution, and the non-linear relationship between AI knowledge and acceptance, ensuring messages resonate with diverse segments of the population.18\n\n  * Collaborate with Media: Engage proactively and transparently with media outlets to ensure balanced and accurate narratives about AI. This collaboration is essential for educating the public about both the immense benefits and the inherent risks of AI, thereby preventing the amplification of fear and misinformation.12\n\n## 6\\. Conclusion: A Path Forward for Ethical and Safe AI\n\nThis report has underscored that the safe and beneficial deployment of high-\nstakes autonomous AI systems is not a singular challenge but a complex,\ninterconnected endeavor. It demands simultaneous attention to navigating\nirresolvable moral dilemmas, ensuring robust technical validation, and\ndiligently cultivating public trust. The analysis reveals that the challenges\nare fundamentally socio-technical, extending beyond mere engineering problems\nto encompass profound ethical, societal, and psychological dimensions. This\nnecessitates an inherently interdisciplinary approach, fostering collaboration\namong technologists, ethicists, legal scholars, social scientists, and\npolicymakers.\n\nMoving forward, the path to responsible AI integration requires a continuous\ncommitment to explicit value alignment, adaptive regulatory frameworks,\ntransparent and explainable systems, rigorous and ongoing validation, and\nproactive, empathetic public engagement. By embracing these multi-faceted\nstrategies, society can harness the transformative potential of AI to enhance\nhuman well-being and societal progress, ensuring that autonomous systems are\ndeveloped and deployed with unwavering adherence to ethical principles,\nuncompromising safety standards, and the full confidence of the public they\nserve.\n\n#### Works cited\n\n  1. arxiv.org, accessed on May 21, 2025, [https://arxiv.org/html/2504.18328v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.18328v1)\n\n  2.
