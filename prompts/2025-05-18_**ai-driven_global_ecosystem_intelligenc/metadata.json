Introduction: The Urgency of Planetary Health and the Promise of AI\n\nThe planet is facing an interconnected crisis characterized by escalating\nrates of biodiversity loss and the accelerating impacts of climate change.\nBiodiversity, the variety of life in an ecosystem, plays a vital role in\nmaintaining the balance and resilience of natural environments.1 Just as\ndiverse data inputs fuel the adaptability and intelligence of artificial\nintelligence, biodiversity makes ecosystems strong and capable of withstanding\ndisruptions.1 The current rates of species extinction and habitat degradation\nthreaten this essential diversity, impacting ecosystem functions and\nultimately undermining planetary health.2\n\nCompounding the biodiversity crisis are the growing impacts of climate change,\nwhich are manifesting in more frequent and intense extreme weather events,\nrising sea levels, and widespread habitat degradation.4 These changes are not\nonly affecting natural ecosystems but also posing significant challenges to\nhuman societies and infrastructure.5 The need for proactive and adaptive\nsolutions to these interconnected environmental problems has never been more\nurgent. Climate change acts as a significant stressor on already fragile\necosystems, further emphasizing the urgency for advanced tools to understand\nand respond to these impacts.4 The urgency necessitates a shift from reactive\nconservation efforts to strategies that can anticipate and mitigate future\nenvironmental challenges.\n\nThe concept of planetary health recognizes the profound interdependence\nbetween human and natural systems.7 It emphasizes the need for integrated\nsolutions that address environmental, social, and economic dimensions\nsimultaneously.7 This holistic framework aligns with the multifaceted\napplications of artificial intelligence in sustainability, suggesting that\neffective solutions require a comprehensive and interconnected approach.9\nAddressing the complex challenges of planetary health demands a systems-level\nunderstanding, and artificial intelligence, with its capacity to analyze\nintricate and interconnected data, is uniquely positioned to contribute to\nthis understanding and the development of integrated solutions that consider\nvarious interacting factors.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stands out as a transformative technology with\nthe potential to revolutionize our approach to these pressing environmental\nchallenges.10 Its ability to process vast amounts of data, discern complex\npatterns, and generate predictions offers capabilities that traditional\nenvironmental monitoring and management methods often lack.10 This suggests a\nfundamental shift in how we can understand and interact with the environment,\nmoving towards more informed and proactive strategies. This report introduces\nthe concept of AI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence as the application of\nartificial intelligence to understand, monitor, predict, and manage global\necosystems for proactive conservation, climate adaptation, and planetary\nhealth restoration. This encompasses a wide array of AI applications, ranging\nfrom sophisticated data analysis and predictive modeling to advanced\nautomation and decision support systems, all with a central focus on improving\nthe health and resilience of our planet's ecosystems.\n\n2\\. Defining AI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence\n\nAt its core, AI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence is built upon several key\ncomponents. The first is the acquisition and integration of data from diverse\nsources.8 This includes a wide range of information such as satellite imagery\nproviding a broad spatial view, sensor networks (including acoustic sensors\nand those detecting environmental DNA) offering detailed local data,\nobservations from citizen science initiatives contributing large-scale\ninformation, and the valuable insights from traditional ecological knowledge\nheld by indigenous communities.8 The effectiveness of AI in understanding\nglobal ecosystems is fundamentally dependent on the availability of high-\nquality data from these varied sources and the ability to integrate them\nseamlessly.\n\nThe second core component involves the application of various AI algorithms\nand techniques.9 These include machine learning, which itself encompasses\nsupervised learning for tasks like classification, unsupervised learning for\ndiscovering hidden patterns, and reinforcement learning for decision-making in\ncomplex environments.9 Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is\nparticularly useful for analyzing complex data like images and sounds.13\nComputer vision enables AI to interpret visual information from sources like\nsatellite images and camera traps.13 Natural language processing allows AI to\nunderstand and process textual data, while predictive analytics focuses on\nforecasting future trends and events.11 The diverse nature of ecological\nchallenges often requires the application of different AI techniques,\nhighlighting the need for a versatile and adaptable approach.\n\nFinally, stakeholder collaboration forms a crucial component.8 Building and\nutilizing AI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence requires effective\ncollaboration among a wide range of stakeholders, including researchers who\ndevelop the AI models, conservationists who apply them in the field,\npolicymakers who use the insights for decision-making, local communities who\nare often directly impacted by environmental changes, and technology\ndevelopers who create the necessary tools and infrastructure.8 This multi-\nstakeholder approach ensures that the AI systems are relevant to real-world\nproblems, usable by those who need them, and that ethical considerations are\nproperly addressed throughout the development and implementation process.\n\nAI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence offers several key functionalities.\nOne of the most important is real-time monitoring and analysis of\necosystems.18 AI systems can continuously process data streams from various\nsensors and platforms, enabling the detection of changes, anomalies, and\npotential threats as they occur.18 This real-time capability allows for more\ntimely interventions and a more dynamic understanding of ecological processes\nthat can change rapidly.\n\nAnother crucial functionality is predictive modeling and forecasting.14 By\nanalyzing historical data and current trends, AI can forecast future states of\necosystems, including aspects like species distribution, habitat suitability,\nthe impacts of climate change, and potential ecological threats such as\ndeforestation or poaching.14 These predictive capabilities are essential for\nproactive conservation and adaptation planning, allowing for a shift from\nsimply reacting to environmental problems to anticipating and preparing for\nthem.\n\nFurthermore, AI plays a significant role in decision support and\noptimization.14 By analyzing complex datasets and considering various factors,\nAI can assist in making more informed conservation and management decisions.14\nThis includes optimizing the allocation of limited resources to achieve\nconservation goals more efficiently and evaluating the potential effectiveness\nof different conservation interventions before they are implemented.\n\nSeveral distinguishing features set AI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence\napart. One is its global scale perspective.7 AI's ability to integrate and\nanalyze data from across the planet provides a comprehensive understanding of\nhow ecosystems are interconnected and how changes in one region can affect\nothers.7 This global view is crucial for addressing environmental challenges\nthat transcend national borders. Another distinguishing feature is its\nproactive and adaptive nature.9 Unlike traditional static approaches, AI\nsystems can continuously learn from new data and adapt their strategies in\nresponse to changing environmental conditions, making them particularly well-\nsuited for managing the dynamic and complex nature of global ecosystems.9\n\n3\\. Leveraging AI for Proactive Biodiversity Conservation\n\nArtificial intelligence is proving to be an invaluable tool in the realm of\nproactive biodiversity conservation, offering capabilities that enhance our\nability to monitor, understand, and protect the planet's diverse species. One\nof the most significant applications lies in enhanced species monitoring and\nidentification.3 AI-powered image recognition and deep learning algorithms can\nanalyze the vast amounts of data generated from various sources, including\ncamera traps that capture images of wildlife in their natural habitats, high-\nresolution satellite imagery providing a bird's-eye view of ecosystems, and\nacoustic recordings that capture the sounds of different species.3 These AI\nsystems can swiftly and accurately identify different species, track their\npopulations, and detect changes in their habitats, significantly increasing\nthe efficiency and accuracy of monitoring efforts.3\n\nSeveral real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of AI in species\nmonitoring. For example, [Wildlife\nInsights](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/) uses AI to manage, analyze, and\nshare camera trap data, enabling quicker responses to threats.14\nThe([https://birdnet.cornell.edu/](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/)) project at\nthe Cornell Lab of Ornithology employs AI to identify over 3,000 bird species\nfrom audio recordings, allowing scientists and citizen scientists to\ncontribute to biodiversity monitoring on an unprecedented scale.16 AI is also\nbeing used to analyze photographs submitted by citizen scientists and\nresearchers to track the movements and populations of endangered whale sharks\nworldwide.15 These examples highlight the practical utility of AI in\nmonitoring diverse species across various environments.\n\nFurthermore, AI is enhancing our ability to monitor biodiversity through its\napplication in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis.14 eDNA sampling involves\ncollecting and analyzing DNA traces present in environmental samples such as\nwater or soil to detect the presence of species, even those that are elusive\nor cryptic and difficult to observe directly.28 AI algorithms are crucial for\nprocessing the vast amounts of genomic data generated from eDNA samples,\nenabling scientists to identify the presence and abundance of different\nspecies in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner.14\n\nBeyond monitoring, AI is playing a critical role in predictive modeling for\nhabitat conservation.15 AI algorithms can analyze various environmental data,\nincluding climate variables, land use patterns, and ecological\ncharacteristics, to forecast future changes in habitat suitability for\nvulnerable species.15 This capability empowers conservation planners to\nprioritize areas for protection, identify corridors for wildlife movement, and\ndevelop proactive conservation strategies to mitigate the effects of habitat\nloss and climate change.15 For instance, AI-powered predictive modeling tools\ncan assess habitat suitability and guide conservation planning in ecologically\nsignificant areas around the world.15 The [Forest\nForesight](https://www.worldwildlife.org/magazine/issues/winter-2023/articles/could-\nai-help-stop-deforestation-before-it-starts) project run by the WWF was able\nto predict deforestation based on satellite input data with 80% accuracy,\ndemonstrating AI's ability to anticipate environmental risks.14 AI is also\nbeing used to identify key habitat corridors that facilitate species movement\nbetween fragmented habitats, which is vital for maintaining genetic diversity\nand allowing species to adapt to changing environmental conditions.15\n\nArtificial intelligence is also proving to be a powerful tool in combating\nillegal wildlife trafficking and poaching.15 AI technologies can analyze vast\nquantities of data from various sources, including social media platforms,\nonline marketplaces, shipping records, and sensor networks deployed in\nprotected areas, to detect patterns, anomalies, and trends that are indicative\nof wildlife crime.15 This provides law enforcement agencies with valuable\nintelligence to target and disrupt criminal networks involved in the illegal\ntrade of endangered species and their products.15 Platforms like SMART\n(Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool) and PAWS (Protection Assistant for\nWildlife Security) utilize AI algorithms to analyze patrol data, camera trap\nfootage, and other information to predict poaching hotspots and optimize the\ndeployment of ranger patrols, leading to more effective anti-poaching\nefforts.16\n\nAI is also enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of conservation\ninvestments and planning.14 By analyzing diverse datasets that include\ninformation on habitat connectivity, genetic diversity, species interactions,\nand conservation costs, AI can help optimize conservation strategies, ensuring\nthat resources are allocated in the most impactful way.14 The Conservation\nArea Prioritization Through Artificial Intelligence (CAPTAIN) project, for\nexample, used reinforcement learning to train models for conservation\nprioritization that best use available data and resources to optimize\nconservation efforts, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI in identifying\npriority conservation areas.14\n\nFinally, AI is playing a crucial role in citizen science and public engagement\nin biodiversity conservation.15 AI-powered mobile apps and online platforms\nprovide user-friendly interfaces that enable volunteers to contribute valuable\ndata on species sightings, environmental conditions, and other ecological\ninformation.15 These platforms often incorporate AI-driven image recognition\nand other techniques to help users identify species and validate their\nobservations.16 Projects like iNaturalist utilize AI to help users identify\nspecies from photographs, enhancing public engagement in conservation and\ngenerating large datasets for scientific research.16\n\n4\\. AI-Powered Climate Adaptation Strategies\n\nThe escalating impacts of climate change necessitate innovative and effective\nadaptation strategies, and artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful\ntool in this endeavor. AI excels at predictive modeling and developing early\nwarning systems for climate impacts.6 By analyzing vast datasets of historical\nclimate data, satellite imagery, and real-time sensor feeds, AI algorithms can\ngenerate more accurate and timely forecasts of extreme weather events such as\nhurricanes, floods, and droughts.6 These improved warnings allow communities,\ninfrastructure operators, and governments to prepare more effectively,\npotentially reducing damage and saving lives.6 Beyond weather-related events,\nAI is also being used to develop early warning systems for other ecological\nthreats, including disease outbreaks and potential ecosystem collapses, by\ndetecting subtle signals in environmental data that may precede these\ncrises.25\n\nIn the agricultural sector, AI-driven precision agriculture is enhancing\nclimate resilience.6 AI algorithms analyze data on soil conditions, weather\nforecasts, and plant health to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest\nmanagement.6 This targeted approach minimizes resource waste, maximizes crop\nyields, and enhances food security under changing climatic conditions.6 The\nuse of drones and satellite imagery, analyzed by AI, allows for the monitoring\nof crop health over large areas, enabling timely interventions where needed.6\n\nWater resource management and conservation are also benefiting significantly\nfrom AI.6 AI models can analyze hydrological data, climate forecasts, and\nwater usage patterns to predict water availability, detect leaks in\ndistribution systems, and improve water allocation decisions, helping to\naddress growing water scarcity issues exacerbated by climate change.6 Smart\nirrigation systems powered by AI can automatically adjust watering schedules\nbased on real-time weather conditions and soil moisture levels, further\nconserving water in agriculture.6\n\nFurthermore, AI is playing a crucial role in climate-resilient infrastructure\nplanning and management.6 By analyzing climate risk data, AI can help identify\nvulnerabilities in existing infrastructure and guide the development of\nclimate-resilient designs for new infrastructure projects, from transportation\nnetworks to buildings to water systems.6 AI-driven systems can also optimize\ntraffic flow in urban areas, reducing congestion and emissions, and manage\nenergy use in buildings to minimize waste and improve sustainability.53\n\n5\\. The Role of Multi-Scale Data Fusion in Climate Adaptation\n\nA comprehensive understanding of climate change impacts and the development of\neffective adaptation strategies require the integration of diverse data\nstreams from various sources and scales.6 This includes data from global\nclimate models providing large-scale projections, satellite imagery offering a\nsynoptic view of the Earth's surface, ground-based sensor networks capturing\nlocal environmental conditions, and even socio-economic data reflecting human\nactivities and vulnerabilities.6 AI algorithms are particularly well-suited\nfor processing and analyzing such heterogeneous datasets, identifying complex\npatterns and relationships that might be missed by traditional analytical\nmethods.44\n\nThe fusion of data from different spatial and temporal scales enhances the\naccuracy and resolution of climate models and impact projections.48 For\ninstance, AI models can integrate global climate model outputs with regional\nclimate data and local sensor measurements to provide more detailed and\nreliable predictions of climate change impacts at local and regional levels,\nwhich are crucial for effective adaptation planning.48 An example of this is a\nresearch project that leveraged multimodal generative artificial intelligence,\nintegrating satellite imagery, ground-based sensor networks, historical crop\ndata, and local farming practices to generate context-specific agricultural\nrecommendations for climate adaptation.68 Another study developed a method to\nenhance land surface temperature estimation by integrating ECOSTRESS satellite\ndata with high-temporal-resolution meteorological data using AI, improving\nspatial and temporal coverage.73 These examples demonstrate the tangible\nbenefits of data fusion in improving our understanding of climate change\nimpacts.\n\nMulti-scale data fusion also supports the development of adaptation strategies\ntailored to specific local conditions and vulnerabilities.68 Climate change\nimpacts are not uniform across the globe, and adaptation measures need to be\ncontext-specific to be effective.68 By integrating climate and environmental\ndata with socio-economic information, AI can help inform adaptation planning\nthat considers human factors, such as the vulnerability of specific\ncommunities or the economic implications of different adaptation options.68\nThis ensures that adaptation strategies are not only environmentally sound but\nalso socially equitable and economically feasible.\n\n6\\. Predicting and Mitigating Ecological Crises with AI\n\nArtificial intelligence is playing an increasingly vital role in predicting\nand mitigating a wide range of ecological crises. AI is instrumental in\ndeveloping and enhancing early warning systems for environmental threats.5 By\nanalyzing real-time data from diverse sources such as satellite imagery,\nsensor networks, and social media, AI algorithms can detect early signs of\nimpending ecological threats, including wildfires, floods, pollution\noutbreaks, and the spread of diseases.5 This early detection enables more\ntimely interventions, potentially reducing the severity and impact of these\ncrises. For example, AI-powered systems are being used to detect deforestation\nin near real-time using satellite imagery, to predict the behavior and spread\nof wildfires by analyzing weather patterns and terrain data, and to monitor\nair and water quality through networks of smart sensors.26\n\nFurthermore, AI and machine learning algorithms are being employed to predict\necological tipping points.80 These are critical thresholds in ecosystems\nbeyond which changes can become rapid and potentially irreversible.80 By\nanalyzing complex ecological data, AI can help identify early warning signals\nthat indicate an ecosystem is approaching a tipping point, such as shifts in\nspecies behavior or changes in environmental conditions.80 Research is\nunderway to use AI to forecast climate tipping points, predict pandemics, and\ndetect potential ecological collapses, providing an opportunity for proactive\nmeasures to prevent these catastrophic shifts.82\n\nIn addition to prediction, AI can assist in mitigating ecological crises\nthrough AI-driven interventions.25 During a crisis, such as a natural\ndisaster, AI can analyze real-time information to help plan and optimize\nresponse efforts, including the allocation of resources and the coordination\nof emergency services.25 AI-powered drones equipped with sensors can be\nrapidly deployed to assess the extent of damage in affected areas, providing\ntimely and detailed information to guide rescue and recovery operations.29\nThese drones can also be used for targeted conservation interventions, such as\ndelivering seeds for reforestation or applying treatments to combat invasive\nspecies.29\n\n7\\. Towards a Planetary Digital Twin for Holistic Ecosystem Management\n\nThe concept of a planetary digital twin is gaining traction as a powerful tool\nfor achieving holistic ecosystem management.91 A planetary digital twin can be\ndefined as a highly accurate virtual representation of the Earth system,\nintegrating diverse data sources and complex models to simulate its behavior\nand evolution over time.91 This virtual replica aims to mirror the intricate\nprocesses and interactions within the Earth's physical, biological, and social\ncomponents, providing a comprehensive platform for understanding and managing\nour planet.95 Initiatives such as the European Commission's Destination Earth\n(DestinE) and NVIDIA's Earth-2 represent significant efforts to build such\nsophisticated digital twins, highlighting the growing global interest in their\npotential.57\n\nThe potential applications of a planetary digital twin for ecosystem\nmanagement are vast. It can be used for comprehensive environmental\nassessment, allowing for the continuous monitoring of ecosystem health and the\ntracking of environmental changes over time by integrating diverse data\nlayers.92 A digital twin can also be instrumental in simulating the impacts of\nclimate change on ecosystems, enabling researchers and policymakers to explore\ndifferent adaptation and mitigation scenarios in a virtual environment before\nimplementing them in the real world.57 Furthermore, a planetary digital twin\nhas the potential for optimizing resource management, predicting natural\ndisasters with greater accuracy, and supporting sustainable development by\nproviding a platform to assess the environmental impacts of various human\nactivities and policies.57\n\n8\\. AI as the Engine of a Planetary Digital Twin\n\nArtificial intelligence is the driving force behind the realization of a\nplanetary digital twin. The sheer scale and complexity of the data required to\nbuild and continuously update such a virtual representation of the Earth\nsystem necessitate the powerful processing capabilities of AI and machine\nlearning.57 AI algorithms play a crucial role in data assimilation and fusion,\nintelligently combining observational data from various sources, such as\nsatellites and sensors, with the outputs of complex Earth system models to\ncreate a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the planet's\ncurrent state within the digital twin.92\n\nWithin a planetary digital twin, AI also powers the forecasting models,\nenabling real-time or near-real-time predictions of future states of the Earth\nsystem.57 By analyzing vast amounts of historical and real-time data, AI\nalgorithms can learn intricate patterns and relationships, allowing them to\ngenerate more accurate and timely predictions of weather patterns, climate\nchange impacts, and extreme events.57 Furthermore, AI facilitates scenario\nplanning and impact assessment within the digital twin.57 Users can explore\n\"what-if\" questions related to environmental changes or policy decisions, and\nthe AI-powered digital twin can simulate potential outcomes, providing a\nvirtual laboratory for testing different environmental management strategies\nbefore their real-world implementation.57\n\nBeyond data processing and simulation, AI plays a vital role in extracting AI-\ndriven insights and providing decision support from the vast datasets within a\nplanetary digital twin.95 AI algorithms can identify subtle patterns, complex\nrelationships, and anomalies in Earth system data that might be difficult for\nhuman analysts to detect, offering valuable information for more informed\ndecision-making.95 The development of AI digital assistants that can interact\nwith digital twins using natural language further enhances accessibility,\nmaking complex Earth observation data and insights more readily available to a\nwider range of users, including non-experts.113\n\n9\\. Integrating Indigenous Knowledge and Ethical Considerations\n\nThe integration of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) offers a valuable and\noften overlooked dimension to AI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence.116\nIndigenous communities have accumulated profound environmental insights and\nsustainable practices over generations through their close relationship with\nthe land.116 This knowledge provides unique, context-specific solutions and a\nholistic understanding of ecosystems that can significantly complement\nscientific approaches to biodiversity conservation, sustainable resource\nmanagement, and climate resilience.116\n\nArtificial intelligence offers opportunities to analyze, preserve, and scale\nup this wealth of indigenous knowledge for wider application.119 Projects that\ncombine IKS with AI for climate adaptation, such as predicting optimal fishing\nlocations based on traditional ecological knowledge and environmental data, or\nutilizing indigenous knowledge in AI models for reef restoration, demonstrate\nthe potential for synergistic benefits.119\n\nHowever, the integration of AI with ecosystem intelligence necessitates\ncareful consideration of ethical implications. Data sovereignty is paramount,\nensuring that Indigenous communities retain control over their knowledge and\ndata.22 It is crucial to respect their rights and autonomy regarding their\ntraditional knowledge and to prevent its misuse or exploitation.22\nFurthermore, it is essential to address potential biases in AI algorithms and\nstrive for fairness, transparency, and accountability in the development and\ndeployment of these systems.5 AI models trained on biased data can perpetuate\nexisting inequalities, making it imperative to ensure responsible and ethical\nuse in environmental management.5 Finally, community engagement and\nparticipatory approaches are vital in developing AI solutions for\nenvironmental management, ensuring that these tools are relevant, effective,\nand ethically sound, reflecting the needs and values of the communities that\nwill use them.22\n\n10\\. Global Initiatives and Future Directions\n\nNumerous global initiatives are already leveraging AI for biodiversity\nconservation, climate adaptation, and planetary health restoration,\ndemonstrating the power of this technology in addressing environmental\nchallenges.4 Organizations like the Global AI Ecosystem are fostering\nknowledge and collaboration within the AI industry for sustainability.7\nMicrosoft's AI for Earth program supports projects using AI to address\nenvironmental challenges.16 UNEP's World Environment Situation Room leverages\nAI for real-time environmental analysis.4 Furthermore, various digital twin\nprojects, such as Destination Earth and NVIDIA's Earth-2, are pushing the\nboundaries of our ability to model and understand the planet.57\n\nThe future holds immense potential for further advancements in AI algorithms,\ndata availability, and computing power to enhance AI-Driven Global Ecosystem\nIntelligence.5 Emerging trends like the use of generative AI for creating\nsophisticated ecosystem models and the increasing integration of AI with\nrobotics for automated conservation interventions highlight the innovative\npotential of this field.14\n\nDespite the promise, several key challenges must be addressed to fully realize\nthe potential of AI-Driven Global Ecosystem Intelligence.3 These include\naddressing data gaps and ensuring the availability of high-quality,\ncomprehensive datasets, mitigating biases in AI models to ensure fair and\nequitable outcomes, managing the significant computational demands of training\nand running complex AI systems, carefully navigating the ethical\nconsiderations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and the\npotential impacts on local communities, and fostering effective\ninterdisciplinary collaboration among experts from diverse fields to ensure\nthat AI solutions are scientifically sound and practically applicable.\n\nTo advance this field responsibly and effectively, several recommendations can\nbe made. Researchers should focus on developing more robust and explainable AI\nalgorithms, addressing data gaps through innovative data collection methods\nand data sharing initiatives, and rigorously evaluating the performance and\npotential biases of AI models in environmental contexts. Policymakers should\nestablish clear guidelines and regulations for the ethical development and\ndeployment of AI in environmental applications, promote data accessibility\nwhile ensuring data sovereignty, and invest in the necessary infrastructure\nand training to support the adoption of AI-driven solutions. Practitioners\nshould prioritize community engagement in the development and implementation\nof AI tools, ensure that these tools are user-friendly and relevant to local\nneeds, and foster collaboration with AI experts to leverage the full potential\nof this technology for conservation and restoration efforts.\n\n11\\.
