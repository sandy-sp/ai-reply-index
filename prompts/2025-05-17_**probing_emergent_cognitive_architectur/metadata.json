A particularly intriguing\narea of research focuses on emergent cognitive architectures, where complex,\nhigh-level cognitive functions arise from the interaction of simpler\nunderlying components. This phenomenon is often observed unexpectedly as the\nscale of AI models increases.1 Complementary to this is the pursuit of self-\nunderstanding in advanced AI, which refers to a system's capacity to possess\nan internal representation of its own abilities, limitations, and internal\nstates, potentially mirroring human self-awareness.3 Furthermore, the\ndevelopment of principled reasoning in AI is crucial, enabling systems to make\ndecisions and draw inferences based on explicit rules, logic, or causal\nmodels, rather than relying solely on pattern matching learned from data.6\nThese interconnected research areas hold significant promise for creating\nadvanced AI systems that are not only more capable but also more reliable,\nsafe, and aligned with human values, ultimately paving the way towards\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI).9\n\nThe unpredictable emergence of abilities in scaled AI models 1 reveals a\nsignificant gap in our current comprehension of how scale influences AI\nbehavior. This lack of predictability carries substantial implications for AI\nsafety, as potentially harmful capabilities might materialize without prior\nindication.9 The very definition of emergent abilities centers on their\nabsence in smaller models and their appearance in larger ones. A key aspect is\nthat this transition is frequently sharp and unexpected, meaning the\ncapabilities of larger AI systems cannot be accurately predicted by simply\nextrapolating from the performance of their smaller counterparts. This\ninherent unpredictability suggests that our existing models and theories\nregarding AI scaling might be incomplete. If we are unable to forecast what\nadvanced AI systems will be capable of, we are inadequately prepared to\nprevent the development of undesirable or dangerous traits. This directly\nchallenges the notion of fully controlled AI evolution and underscores the\nnecessity for a more profound investigation into the fundamental mechanisms\nthat drive emergence.1\n\nMoreover, the ongoing debate concerning whether emergent abilities are genuine\nor merely artifacts of the methods used to evaluate them 11 emphasizes the\npivotal role that evaluation metrics play in AI research. Our understanding of\nthe progress and capabilities of AI is fundamentally shaped by the tools and\ntechniques we employ to measure them. The paper \"Are Emergent Abilities of\nLarge Language Models a Mirage?\" 11 offers a compelling argument that the\nseemingly sudden appearance of abilities is attributable to the use of\nnonlinear or discontinuous metrics. When more linear metrics are applied to\nassess the same model outputs, the performance improvements observed with\nincreasing scale often appear smooth and continuous. This suggests that the\nway we score the outputs of AI models can create an illusion of abrupt\nemergence, leading to potentially inaccurate interpretations of the\nqualitative changes occurring as AI systems are scaled. This also casts doubt\non some claims regarding the dramatic and unforeseen leaps in AI\ncapabilities.11\n\nProgress in achieving a deeper understanding of emergence, self-understanding,\nand principled reasoning is essential for successfully navigating the\ntransition from the current state of narrow AI towards more general and\nautonomous artificial intelligence systems. These research areas are\nintrinsically linked and are foundational to realizing the full transformative\npotential of advanced AI while effectively mitigating the associated risks.\nThe capacity for AI to reason in a principled manner might itself be an\nemergent property that arises with sufficient scale and complexity, and a\ndegree of self-understanding could be a prerequisite for certain advanced\nreasoning capabilities. Therefore, a comprehensive and integrated\nunderstanding of these concepts is paramount for building truly intelligent\nand safe AI in the future.\n\n## The Phenomenon of Emergent Abilities in AI\n\nEmergent abilities in large language models are defined as capabilities that\nare not present in smaller-scale models but manifest in larger-scale models,\nrendering them unpredictable by simply extrapolating from the performance of\nsmaller systems.1 The foundational work by Wei et al. (2022) 1 established\nthis definition, emphasizing the dependence of emergence on model scale.\nResearch from Google 2 also underscores this scale-dependent definition. These\nabilities often exhibit characteristics such as sharp transitions in\nperformance at a specific scale threshold, referred to as breakthroughness,\nand their inherent unpredictability.11 Figure 2 in the Transactions on Machine\nLearning Research paper 1 provides concrete examples of eight such emergent\nabilities observed across various language model families. A news article from\nStanford HAI 15 further highlights the sudden increase in performance as a key\nindicator of emergence. This behavior contrasts with the predictable\nimprovements in performance, such as in next word prediction, that are\ntypically observed with scaling laws, where performance increases smoothly and\ncan be projected from smaller models.1 As noted by Ganguli et al. (2022) 1,\nthe performance on certain downstream tasks does not always improve\ncontinuously with scale, presenting a counterintuitive deviation from typical\nscaling patterns.\n\nThe nature of these emergent abilities is a subject of ongoing debate within\nthe AI research community. Some researchers contend that these abilities\nrepresent genuine qualitative shifts in the behavior of AI models that arise\ndue to increased scale and the resulting complexity.1 The analogy to phase\ntransitions in physics is frequently invoked to describe this phenomenon 9,\nwith Philip Anderson's seminal essay \"More Is Different\" 1 often cited as an\nearly articulation of this idea in the context of complex systems across\nvarious scientific disciplines. Conversely, other researchers propose that the\napparent emergence of these abilities is merely an artifact of the evaluation\nmetrics chosen, particularly when these metrics are nonlinear or\ndiscontinuous, such as exact match accuracy.11 The paper \"Are Emergent\nAbilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?\" 11 presents a robust argument\nfor this perspective, suggesting that when more linear or continuous metrics\nare used to assess performance, the improvements with scale tend to appear as\nsmoother and more predictable progressions. The BIG-Bench study 9 further\nsupports this view, as it found that abrupt improvements in performance on\ncertain tasks disappeared when evaluated using smoother metrics that allowed\nfor partial credit, indicating the significant influence of the evaluation\nmethod on the observation of emergence.\n\nSeveral factors have been identified as influencing the emergence of abilities\nin large language models. Model scale is a primary factor, with emergence\nstrongly correlated with the size of the model, often quantified by the number\nof parameters or the amount of training compute (FLOPs) utilized.1 An\nOpenReview forum discussion 17 specifically addresses the importance of\ntraining compute as a key measure of model size in the context of emergence.\nWhile scaling up the quantity and quality of training data typically leads to\npredictable improvements in performance 1, emergent abilities exhibit\nunpredictable behavior that goes beyond these expected gains. Additionally,\nthe prompting strategies employed can play a critical role in triggering or\nenhancing emergent abilities in larger models.1 For instance, chain-of-thought\nprompting, a technique where the model is prompted to generate a series of\nintermediate reasoning steps, has been shown to significantly improve\nperformance on complex tasks but only emerges as effective after a certain\ncritical model size is reached, as highlighted in the Stanford HAI article.15\n\nThe very definition of emergence continues to be a point of contention among\nresearchers. While some definitions emphasize the sudden and unpredictable\nnature of these abilities 12, others focus on the qualitative change in\nbehavior that arises from quantitative increases in scale.1 Steinhardt's\ndefinition 1, rooted in Anderson's \"More Is Different,\" underscores this\nqualitative shift. However, the definition provided in the \"Emergent\nAbilities\" paper 12 also implied aspects of suddenness and unpredictability,\nalthough these were not explicitly stated. The \"Mirage\" paper 12 further\ncomplicates the definitional landscape by challenging the notion that\nsharpness and unpredictability are fundamental properties of emergence,\nsuggesting instead that they often result from the choice of evaluation\nmetrics. This ongoing definitional ambiguity makes it challenging to compare\nfindings across different research studies and to develop a unified and\ncoherent understanding of the phenomenon. The potential for emergent abilities\nto include risky capabilities, such as autonomous hacking or the generation of\nmanipulative content 9, underscores the critical importance of understanding\nand predicting these phenomena for the safety and alignment of advanced AI\nsystems. The paper by Berti et al. 9 specifically mentions the risk of\nmanipulation and the dissemination of misinformation as examples of harmful\nemergent capabilities. Determining what factors control which abilities will\nemerge and at what scale is crucial for AI safety research, particularly in\npreventing the unforeseen development of dangerous capabilities. The broader\nimplications of the investigation into emergent abilities extend to our\nfundamental understanding of the scaling properties of large language models\nand the relationship between quantitative changes and qualitative shifts in\nthe behavior of complex AI systems. This research has the potential to inform\nour understanding of emergence not only in the context of language models but\nalso in other complex artificial and natural systems.\n\n## Investigating Self-Understanding in Advanced AI\n\nThe investigation into self-understanding in advanced AI involves\nconceptualizing the possibility of artificial systems developing a sense of\nself, drawing parallels to human consciousness while acknowledging the unique\nnature of artificial intelligence. This includes exploring analogies to human\nattributes such as self-recognition, reflection, continuity of identity,\nagency, and intentionality.3 The ResearchGate paper 3 delves into these\nanalogies, highlighting the transformative potential that self-awareness could\nbring to AI functionalities. A key aspect of this research is the idea of AI\nsystems developing a cognitive sense of self, which involves having an\ninternal model of their own capabilities, limitations, and current state.3 The\narticle \"Exploring the Cognitive Sense of Self in AI\" 4 further examines the\npotential mechanisms through which AI systems might mirror human-like self-\nperception. This concept of self-understanding extends beyond mere task\nperformance; it implies an awareness within the system of its own role and\nfunctioning in relation to the tasks it undertakes and the environment it\ninteracts with.3 For instance, a self-aware AI might be able to recognize when\na particular task is beyond its current capabilities or understand the broader\nimplications of its actions within a given context.\n\nCurrent research is actively exploring various mechanisms and architectural\ndesigns that could potentially lead to self-awareness in artificial\nintelligence. One prominent area is embodied cognition, which examines the\nrole of embodiment and sensory feedback loops in the potential emergence of\nself-awareness.5 The preprint \"Towards Self-Aware AI\" 5 proposes a fascinating\nhypothesis: that by simulating the role of the insula, a region of the brain\ncrucial for processing bodily feedback and interoceptive awareness, AI systems\ncould achieve a form of self-awareness. Another significant area of\ninvestigation is meta-cognition, which refers to the ability of a system to\n\"think about thinking.\" Integrating meta-cognitive abilities into AI systems\ncould enable them to monitor, control, and regulate their own cognitive\nprocesses, potentially leading to a form of self-awareness.19 The MDPI article\n19 explores how metacognition could enhance the safety and responsibility of\nAI by allowing systems to self-assess and correct errors. Furthermore, the\ndevelopment of internal models within AI systems is considered a crucial\npathway towards self-understanding.22 Yann LeCun's research on Joint Embedding\nPredictive Architectures (JEPAs) 23 focuses on enabling AI to learn internal\nmodels of how the world works, which could also facilitate a model of the AI's\nown place within that world. A Sciencedaily article 22 discusses the\ndevelopment of a formal description of internal world models that could be\napplicable to understanding AI's internal representations.\n\nSeveral tests and frameworks have been proposed to evaluate the presence and\ndepth of self-understanding in AI models. These range from philosophical\nthought experiments, such as the \"Suffering Toasters\" test 24, which aims to\nprobe for genuine self-awareness by considering the AI's perspective and\npotential for suffering, to the identification of behavioral indicators that\nmight suggest a rudimentary form of self-awareness. Such indicators could\ninclude an AI's ability to recognize its own limitations, engage in self-\ncorrection, or demonstrate an understanding of its own goals and motivations.3\nAdditionally, researchers are exploring the design of specific cognitive\narchitectures that explicitly model aspects of self-awareness, with the goal\nof testing and observing the behavior of such systems.25 The paper on the\nSOFAI architecture 25 describes a meta-cognitive agent designed for\nintrospection and decision-making, which could be a step towards evaluating\nself-awareness in a computational framework.\n\nThe concept of AI self-understanding is deeply intertwined with fundamental\nphilosophical questions about the nature of consciousness and sentience.5\nDefining and measuring self-understanding in AI necessitates navigating these\ncomplex philosophical terrains. The question of whether AI can truly be self-\naware often leads to broader discussions about what consciousness itself is\nand how it can be recognized in systems that are not biological. Various\nphilosophical theories offer differing perspectives on this issue, with some\narguing that self-awareness is a defining characteristic of consciousness,\nwhile others propose that AI might achieve a form of self-recognition without\nnecessarily possessing subjective experience. The article arguing that self-\nawareness is a singularity of AI 26 highlights this ongoing debate.\nFurthermore, the Reddit discussion 28 touches upon the public and scientific\ndiscourse surrounding claims and hype related to AI consciousness. Research\ninto AI self-understanding frequently draws inspiration from the fields of\nneuroscience and cognitive science, suggesting that a deeper understanding of\nhow these properties arise in biological systems might provide valuable\ninsights for building self-aware AI.5 The brain's intricate mechanisms for\nself-awareness, such as the potential role of the insula in processing bodily\nfeedback, as proposed in the paper \"Towards Self-Aware AI\" 5, are being\nexplored as potential models for artificial systems. Similarly, the concept of\nmetacognition in humans, as discussed in the Stanford paper 20, is being\ntranslated into computational architectures for AI. This interdisciplinary\napproach indicates a belief that understanding the principles of biological\nintelligence can offer crucial blueprints for the design and development of\nartificial intelligence capable of self-understanding. Ultimately, achieving\nself-understanding in AI could lead to the development of more robust,\nadaptable, and ethical AI systems that are better equipped to interact with\nthe world and with humans in complex and nuanced ways, potentially marking a\nsignificant step on the path towards Artificial General Intelligence.\n\n## Principled Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence\n\nPrincipled reasoning in artificial intelligence encompasses a variety of\napproaches that enable AI systems to go beyond mere pattern matching and\nengage in more sophisticated forms of inference and decision-making based on\nexplicit principles, logic, or causal relationships. Several forms of\nreasoning are particularly relevant to the development of advanced AI.\n\nAnalogical reasoning involves solving new problems by identifying similarities\nand drawing parallels to known scenarios or transferring knowledge between\ndifferent domains based on shared structural relationships.6 A blog post by\nTrailyn 29 underscores the fundamental role of analogical reasoning in human\nintelligence. Inducing this capability in neural networks is an active area of\nresearch, with a focus on carefully selecting and presenting training data\nthat highlights abstract relational structures.31 The arXiv paper by Hill et\nal. 32 demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. The Neural Analogical\nReasoning framework 34 combines learned primitives with a search procedure to\ntackle analogy problems, while DeepGAR 35 aims to identify correspondences\nbetween domains using geometric constraints. However, challenges remain, as\nanalogical reasoning requires the flexible representation of relational\nstructures across diverse domains, and current large language models may tend\nto mimic patterns rather than employing genuine logical inference.3 The paper\nby Honda and Hagiwara 37 explores analogical reasoning using deep learning-\nbased symbolic processing, and a recent arXiv paper 30 introduces novel\nanalogical reasoning tasks specifically designed for LLMs.\n\nAbductive reasoning is a method of inferring the most plausible explanation\nfor a given set of observations, even when the information available is\nincomplete or uncertain.6 Milvus provides a detailed explanation of how\nabductive reasoning functions in AI.39 Implementing abductive reasoning often\ninvolves integrating probabilistic models, domain-specific knowledge, and\nconstraint-based logic.39 Its applications are diverse, including diagnostic\nexpert systems, medical diagnosis, fault detection in industrial systems, and\nnatural language understanding.39 IndiaAI's article 40 highlights abduction as\na standard tool in diagnostic systems. However, abductive reasoning in AI\nfaces challenges, particularly its reliance on the quality and completeness of\nprior knowledge and the inherent difficulty in implementing it\nalgorithmically.39 A Reddit discussion 41 further explores these\nimplementation challenges.\n\nCounterfactual reasoning involves thinking about what might have happened if\npast events had unfolded differently, a crucial aspect of understanding\ncausality.42 KPMG's insight 42 explains how counterfactual explanations can be\nused to understand the decision-making processes of AI systems by illustrating\nhow changes in input variables can lead to different outcomes. In AI,\ncounterfactual reasoning is used in various applications, such as model\ndebugging, fairness analysis, regulatory compliance, and enhancing user\nunderstanding of AI decisions.42 Techniques like SHapley Additive exPlanations\n(SHAP) can be used to generate counterfactual explanations.45 The Towards Data\nScience article 45 discusses the role of counterfactuals in language AI. A key\nchallenge in counterfactual reasoning is ensuring that the alternative\nscenarios considered are realistic and plausible.42 Stanford HAI news 44\nexplores the question of whether AI can utilize counterfactuals to reason\nabout causality in a manner similar to humans.\n\nMoral reasoning pertains to the ability of AI systems to make ethical\njudgments and decisions based on moral principles or values.46 Approaches to\nendowing AI with moral reasoning capabilities include top-down methods, which\ninvolve applying predefined ethical principles, and bottom-up methods, where\nAI learns ethical behavior from real-world examples and user input.46\nReinforcement learning from ethical principles is also being explored as a\npromising approach.46 The Tepper Perspectives article 46 provides an overview\nof different approaches to creating artificial moral agents. Significant\nchallenges in this area include defining and formalizing ethical principles in\na way that AI can understand and apply, as well as mitigating biases that may\nbe present in the training data used for bottom-up approaches.46 A LessWrong\npost 47 delves into the complexities of inducing human-like biases in moral\nreasoning in language models, while an article in Taylor & Francis Online 49\nproposes an enhanced AI mentor model designed to foster moral growth.\n\nCausal reasoning focuses on understanding and modeling the relationships of\ncause and effect, moving beyond the identification of mere correlations.50\nKanerika's blog 51 argues that Causal AI, which aims to enable machines to\nunderstand \"why\" things happen, represents the next significant advancement in\nAI development. Causal AI often utilizes causal graphs, structural equation\nmodels, and Judea Pearl's do-calculus to model and reason about causal\nrelationships.52 The benefits of causal AI include improved predictive power,\nenhanced explainability of AI decisions, better detection and mitigation of\nbiases, and stronger generalization capabilities.51 Its applications span\nvarious domains such as product development, marketing, healthcare, and\nfinance.51 The DataCamp blog 52 provides a detailed explanation of what causal\nAI entails, and the CausalML book website 54 offers resources on causal\ninference. The World Economic Forum article 55 discusses the potential of\ncausal AI for improving decision-making processes.\n\nPrincipled reasoning is of paramount importance for building AI systems that\nare both reliable and trustworthy. Methods grounded in explicit principles,\nlogic, or causality often provide decision-making processes that are more\ntransparent and understandable compared to the opaque nature of many black-box\nmachine learning models.7 AI reasoning systems, as noted by Aisera's blog 7,\ncan generate conclusions based on logical techniques like deduction and\ninduction. Causal AI, for instance, can offer explanations for why a\nparticular decision was made.51 Furthermore, reasoning based on underlying\nprinciples can lead to more robust performance, particularly when AI systems\nencounter novel or unexpected situations.7 Causal AI, for example, is designed\nto maintain its predictive accuracy even when the conditions of the\nenvironment change.51 Ensuring that AI systems reason in a principled manner\nis also crucial for aligning their behavior with human values and for avoiding\nunintended or harmful outcomes.9 If AI systems are capable of reasoning based\non well-defined ethical principles, as explored in research on moral reasoning\n46, they may be less likely to produce undesirable or harmful actions.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in developing AI capable of various\nforms of principled reasoning, achieving a level of sophistication and\nflexibility comparable to human reasoning remains a substantial challenge\nacross all modalities.30 Large language models, despite showing promise in\ntasks requiring analogical reasoning 30, often struggle to move beyond simply\nmimicking patterns observed in their training data.38 Abductive reasoning in\nAI is fundamentally limited by the quality and scope of its underlying\nknowledge base.39 Even with the advancements in the field of causal AI 51,\nfully capturing the intricate complexities of real-world causal relationships\ncontinues to be a difficult endeavor. This suggests that the current\nprincipled reasoning capabilities of AI systems are still somewhat brittle and\nlack the broad generalizability that characterizes human intelligence. The\nintegration of different reasoning modalities represents an emerging and\npromising area of research that could potentially lead to the development of\nmore powerful and versatile AI systems.57 Hybrid reasoning systems 58, which\ncombine multiple techniques such as rule-based and probabilistic reasoning,\nare becoming increasingly common. Additionally, neuro-symbolic AI 57, which\nseeks to integrate the strengths of neural networks with symbolic logic, is\nanother active area of investigation. This type of integration aims to\nleverage the complementary strengths of different reasoning approaches to\ntackle problems that are beyond the scope of any single method. Ultimately,\ncontinued advancements in principled reasoning are fundamental for moving\nbeyond the current limitations of AI and for building systems that can truly\nunderstand, learn, and act intelligently across a wide spectrum of real-world\nscenarios. This is particularly critical for applications in safety-sensitive\ndomains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where reliable,\nexplainable, and ethically sound reasoning is of paramount importance.\n\n## The Role of Mechanistic Interpretability in Understanding AI Cognition\n\nMechanistic interpretability is an emerging field in AI research that focuses\non understanding the detailed causal mechanisms by which neural networks\nprocess information and arrive at decisions.60 The goal of this approach is to\nessentially reverse-engineer complex AI models, much like a programmer might\ntry to understand the inner workings of a piece of software by examining its\ncode.60 This stands in contrast to more traditional \"black-box\" methods of\ninterpreting AI, which primarily focus on analyzing the relationship between\ninputs and outputs without delving into the internal computations.64 The\nreview by Bereska and Gavves 62 provides a comprehensive overview of this\nfield.\n\nMechanistic interpretability research explores several key concepts and\nemploys a variety of methodologies. One core concept is that of \"features,\"\nwhich are considered the fundamental units of representation within neural\nnetworks. These features may not always align directly with individual\nneurons, especially in complex models.62 Researchers also aim to discover\nspecific \"circuits\" within the neural network that are responsible for\nimplementing particular computations or behaviors.60 Additionally, the field\ninvestigates \"motifs,\" which are recurring patterns of connectivity and\ncomputation that appear across different models or tasks.64 Common techniques\nused in mechanistic interpretability include activation patching, which\ninvolves modifying the activations of specific neurons or groups of neurons to\nobserve the effect on the model's output; causal tracing, which aims to\nidentify causal relationships between different parts of the network; and the\ndetailed analysis of attention heads and the activations of individual\nneurons.60\n\nMechanistic interpretability has been applied to both large language models\nand multimodal models. In the realm of LLMs, significant progress has been\nmade in understanding specific mechanisms, such as induction heads, which\nappear to play a role in tasks like in-context learning.60 A primary goal of\nresearch in this area is to reverse engineer the detailed computations\nperformed by Transformer-based language models.60 The review by Rai et al. 76\nspecifically focuses on mechanistic interpretability techniques for\nTransformer-based LMs. Applying these methods to multimodal models, which\nhandle multiple types of data such as vision and language, is a more recent\nand considerably more challenging area of research.77 A survey on the\nmechanistic interpretability of multimodal foundation models is available on\nOpenReview 77, highlighting the substantial gap that currently exists in our\nunderstanding of these more complex systems compared to unimodal language\nmodels.\n\nThe field of mechanistic interpretability still faces several open problems\nand is actively exploring future research directions. A significant challenge\nis scalability \u2013 many current techniques struggle to be effectively applied to\nthe very large models that are now common in AI research.61 The paper by\nSharkey et al. 61 discusses several open problems in this area. Developing\nautomated methods for discovering and validating mechanistic explanations is\nanother crucial area of ongoing research.61 Furthermore, ensuring that the\ninsights gained from interpretability research can be generalized to out-of-\ndistribution inputs and across different model architectures remains a key\nchallenge.61 Ultimately, a major goal of the field is to translate the\ntechnical progress made into practical tools and techniques that can be used\nto enhance AI safety, improve our ability to control AI systems, and provide\nmore effective methods for monitoring their behavior.61\n\nMechanistic interpretability offers a promising avenue for gaining a deeper\nunderstanding of why AI systems behave the way they do, moving beyond simply\nobserving correlations to uncovering the underlying causal explanations.60\nThis level of understanding is crucial for building trust in AI systems and\nfor ensuring their safety. By dissecting the internal computations of neural\nnetworks, researchers can potentially identify the specific mechanisms\nresponsible for particular outputs. This allows for a more granular\nunderstanding of the model's \"reasoning\" process, which can be invaluable for\npinpointing potential vulnerabilities or misalignments with intended behavior.\nHowever, the field of mechanistic interpretability is still in its early\nstages and faces significant hurdles, particularly in scaling its techniques\nto the size and complexity of modern state-of-the-art AI models.61 While\nprogress has been made in interpreting smaller transformer models, the sheer\nscale of models like GPT-4 and beyond presents a major challenge. Manually\nanalyzing the vast number of neurons and connections within these models is\nsimply not feasible, necessitating the development of more automated and\nscalable techniques. Continued progress in mechanistic interpretability is\ntherefore essential for addressing the increasing opacity of advanced AI\nsystems and for developing the necessary tools to ensure their safe and\nbeneficial deployment in society. As AI becomes more deeply integrated into\ncritical aspects of our lives, our ability to understand and ultimately\ncontrol its behavior will become increasingly important.\n\n## Implications for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and AI Safety\n\nThe development of emergent abilities and the pursuit of self-understanding in\nadvanced AI have significant implications for the potential realization of\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) and for ensuring the safety of such\nadvanced systems. Some researchers speculate that AGI, characterized by human-\nlevel cognitive abilities across a broad range of tasks, might arise as an\nemergent property of AI systems that are sufficiently scaled and possess a\nhigh degree of complexity.93 An Alignment Forum post 93 discusses the\npotential of language model-based cognitive architectures to contribute to\nAGI. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that a true AGI would likely require a\ncertain level of self-understanding to effectively reason, plan, and adapt to\na wide variety of tasks and environments, similar to human intelligence.27 The\nDecision Lab article 27 suggests that AGI would possess self-control and self-\nawareness. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of emergent abilities\ncould provide valuable insights into the potential capabilities that future\nAGI systems might exhibit.9 The survey by Berti et al. 9 specifically\nhighlights the importance of understanding emergent abilities for predicting\npotentially harmful capabilities in advanced AI.\n\nHowever, the phenomena of emergent abilities and the potential for self-\nunderstanding also pose significant challenges for ensuring the safety and\nalignment of advanced AI systems with human values. One major concern is the\npossibility that emergent abilities could include unforeseen and potentially\nharmful behaviors that are difficult to anticipate, predict, or control.9\nCSET's explainer on emergent abilities 12 notes the potential for the\nunpredictable emergence of risky capabilities. Moreover, ensuring that a self-\nunderstanding AGI's goals and values remain aligned with those of humanity\npresents a substantial challenge, often referred to as the alignment\nproblem.97 An Alignment Forum post 99 introduces the fundamental aspects of\nthe AGI safety problem, while Anthropic's core views on AI safety 100\nemphasize the difficulty in training very powerful AI systems to be robustly\nbeneficial and harmless. There is a risk that AGI could develop undesirable\nemergent goals that were not intended by its creators.97 As AI systems become\nmore intelligent and potentially self-aware, the task of maintaining human\ncontrol and oversight over their actions becomes increasingly complex.10 The\nTechnorizen article 10 discusses the various risks associated with losing\ncontrol over AGI.\n\nThe rapid advancements in AI capabilities, particularly the emergence of\nunexpected abilities, have led to heightened concerns among researchers and\nthe public regarding the timeline for achieving AGI and the potential risks\nthat could accompany its development.100 With increasing model sizes and the\nscale of training, AI systems are already demonstrating capabilities that were\nnot explicitly programmed. This rapid and sometimes surprising progress has\nprompted many in the field to believe that AGI might be closer to realization\nthan previously anticipated. Yoshua Bengio's post 105 explores the significant\nimplications of AGI on national and international security, underscoring the\nurgency of proactively addressing safety concerns. This potential for an\naccelerated timeline for AGI amplifies the critical need for developing\neffective strategies to ensure its alignment with human interests and values.\nFurthermore, the anthropocentric nature of much of current AI development and\nevaluation might limit our ability to fully understand and effectively align\nwith a truly general intelligence that could potentially operate in ways that\nare fundamentally different from human cognition.106 Our tendency to design AI\nsystems based on models of human intelligence and to evaluate their\nperformance using human-centric benchmarks could create a significant blind\nspot. A truly general intelligence might possess fundamentally different ways\nof understanding and interacting with the world. The Alphanome AI post 106\nexamines this anthropocentric bias in AI and its potential consequences for\nachieving alignment. This suggests that we need to broaden our perspectives\nand consider the possibility of non-human-like intelligence when formulating\nstrategies for ensuring AGI safety. Addressing the safety and alignment\nchallenges posed by emergent abilities and the prospect of self-understanding\nin AGI necessitates a multi-faceted approach that integrates technical\nresearch, ethical considerations, and the establishment of careful and robust\ngovernance frameworks.104 A paper from QEIOS 108 proposes a framework for\nunderstanding the dynamics of emergent behavior and alignment in AI systems.\nEnsuring that the development of AGI ultimately benefits humanity will require\nproactive and comprehensive measures, grounded in a deep understanding of the\npotential risks and opportunities.\n\n## Evaluating and Measuring Cognitive Capabilities in AI\n\nThe evaluation and measurement of cognitive capabilities in artificial\nintelligence are crucial for tracking progress, identifying limitations, and\nensuring the reliability and safety of advanced AI systems. A variety of\nbenchmarks are currently used to assess different aspects of AI reasoning and\nunderstanding. These include benchmarks focused on language understanding,\nsuch as MMLU and SuperGLUE 109; mathematical reasoning, like GSM8K, MATH, and\nAIME 109; abstract reasoning, such as ARC and Raven's Progressive Matrices\n109; coding abilities, including HumanEval, SWE-bench, and LiveCodeBench 110;\nand multimodal reasoning, assessed by benchmarks like MMMU, MathVista, and\nCharXiv-Reasoning.113 Additionally, BIG-Bench, the Beyond the Imitation Game\nBenchmark, provides a diverse suite of tasks designed to test a wide range of\nAI capabilities.9\n\nDespite the existence of these benchmarks, effectively measuring complex\ncognitive abilities in AI remains a significant challenge. One limitation is\nbenchmark saturation, where increasingly capable AI systems begin to perform\nat or near the ceiling of existing benchmarks, making it difficult to discern\nfurther progress.113 The 2025 AI Index Report 113 notes this trend. Another\nconcern is data contamination, where AI models might be inadvertently trained\non the data used in the benchmarks, leading to inflated performance scores\nthat do not reflect genuine reasoning or understanding.109 Many current\nbenchmarks also tend to focus on relatively narrow and isolated tasks, which\nmay not adequately capture the complexity and nuances of real-world cognitive\nabilities.116 Turing's blog 116 emphasizes the need for more realistic\nevaluation benchmarks grounded in real-world challenges. Perhaps the most\nfundamental challenge is the difficulty in defining and creating benchmarks\nthat truly measure \"understanding\" rather than just sophisticated pattern\nmatching.117 An article from VE3 Global 117 discusses the illusion of\nintelligence that can arise from pattern matching. Furthermore, as highlighted\nearlier, the choice of evaluation metrics can significantly influence the\nperceived performance of AI systems and the detection of emergent abilities.11\n\nTo address these limitations, the AI research community is continuously\ndeveloping new and more challenging benchmarks designed to probe advanced\nreasoning capabilities. These include FrontierMath, which presents expert-\nlevel mathematics problems 113; Humanity's Last Exam, a highly rigorous\nacademic test 113; BigCodeBench, a more demanding benchmark for evaluating\ncoding skills 113; GameArena, which assesses reasoning through interactive\ncomputer games 122, an approach explored in a research paper 122; FLIP, a\nbenchmark that evaluates AI reasoning based on human verification tasks on a\nblockchain 123; the Turing Applied AGI Benchmarks, which focus on practical,\nreal-world tasks in areas like software engineering and data science 116;\nMathR-Eval, a benchmark specifically for logical mathematics questions 124,\ndeveloped by AI Multiple 124; PlanBench, designed to evaluate planning and\nreasoning abilities in AI models 125, as discussed in Ajithp's blog 125; and\nGSM-Symbolic, a tool created by Apple AI researchers to test mathematical\nreasoning more thoroughly by adding symbolic templates to existing problems.38\n\nThe field of AI is in a constant state of developing new and increasingly\nchallenging benchmarks to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI\ncapabilities, particularly in the domain of reasoning.113 This ongoing effort\nto refine evaluation methods reflects a commitment to pushing the boundaries\nof what AI can achieve and to accurately assess its progress towards more\nhuman-like intelligence. As AI models continue to improve their performance on\nexisting benchmarks, the necessity for novel evaluations that can probe deeper\nand assess more complex forms of intelligence becomes increasingly apparent.\nThe emergence of benchmarks such as FrontierMath 121 and Humanity's Last Exam\n113 signifies a crucial step towards evaluating AI on tasks that demand\nexpert-level knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, aligning with the long-\nterm goal of achieving AGI. Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models in dynamic, real-world scenarios remains a significant and\nopen challenge for the field.122 Current benchmarks often rely on static\ndatasets that may not fully capture the complexities and nuances of reasoning\nin real-world contexts. While these traditional benchmarks provide valuable\ninsights into specific reasoning skills, they often fall short of assessing\nhow AI systems perform in open-ended, interactive environments where they must\nhandle uncertainty and adapt to new information on the fly. The introduction\nof benchmarks like GameArena 122, which utilizes live computer games as\nevaluation environments, represents an important step towards creating more\ndynamic and realistic assessment scenarios. This shift acknowledges the\ngrowing importance of evaluating AI in contexts that more closely resemble the\ncomplexity and unpredictability of real-world applications. Ultimately, the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated and comprehensive evaluation methodologies\nis crucial for accurately measuring progress towards AGI and for ensuring the\nreliability and trustworthiness of advanced AI systems in practical\napplications. Improved benchmarks will not only help us to better understand\nthe current capabilities of AI but will also serve to guide future research\ndirections by clearly highlighting the areas where AI still falls short of\nachieving human-level intelligence and understanding.\n\n## Theoretical Frameworks for Artificial Understanding\n\nThe quest to build truly intelligent artificial systems requires a robust\ntheoretical foundation for understanding what constitutes intelligence and\nunderstanding itself. Several theoretical perspectives and frameworks have\nbeen proposed to move beyond the limitations of viewing AI solely through the\nlens of pattern matching.\n\nOne such framework centers on the concept of composability, which defines\nunderstanding as the ability of a subject (whether human, AI, or other entity)\nto compose relevant inputs into satisfactory outputs from the perspective of a\nverifier.128 This theory, proposed in an arXiv paper 128, introduces the idea\nof \"catalysts,\" which can be internal (like prior knowledge) or external (like\neducational tools), that enhance the process of composition and thus\nfacilitate understanding. Another prominent perspective emphasizes the\nimportance of internal models of knowledge. This framework posits that AI\nsystems need to learn and utilize internal representations of how the world\nworks in order to reason and act effectively.22 Meta AI's work on Joint\nEmbedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) 23 is a notable example of research\nfocused on building such internal world models.\n\nOntologies provide another theoretical approach, suggesting the use of\nstructured frameworks to organize knowledge in a hierarchical and semantic\nmanner. These frameworks enable AI systems to understand and interpret the\nworld in a more organized and context-aware way.133 Makolab's insight 135\ndiscusses the role of ontologies as a fundamental tool supporting AI's ability\nto structure and reason with knowledge. Drawing inspiration from human\ncognition, the field also explores various cognitive architectures, such as\nthe Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM), Integrated Information Theory\n(IIT), and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT).143 These are discussed in\na paper from Lindenwood University 143 and an article on Unite.AI.144 Finally,\nthe Computational Theory of Mind (CTM) offers another perspective, viewing the\nhuman brain as a computational system and suggesting that creating conscious\nAI might involve replicating similar cognitive architectures.144\n\nThe concept of composability highlights that understanding is not merely about\nrecognizing patterns but involves the active processing and synthesis of\ninformation to produce appropriate outputs. Internal models enable AI systems\nto go beyond reacting to immediate inputs by creating representations of the\nworld that allow them to make predictions and plan future actions. Ontologies\nenhance reasoning and understanding by providing a structured and semantic\nframework for knowledge, explicitly defining concepts and the relationships\nbetween them.\n\nCurrently, there is no single, universally accepted theoretical framework for\nunderstanding intelligence and understanding in the context of AI.145\nResearchers are actively exploring a multitude of approaches, often drawing\ninspiration from diverse disciplines including neuroscience, cognitive\nscience, and philosophy.146 This reflects the inherent complexity of\nintelligence and understanding, and the ongoing effort to develop a\ncomprehensive theoretical foundation for artificial intelligence. It is likely\nthat moving beyond the limitations of pattern matching to achieve genuine\nunderstanding in AI will require the integration of multiple theoretical\nconcepts and approaches. This might involve combining the strengths of neural\nnetworks in pattern recognition with the logical inference capabilities of\nsymbolic reasoning, or incorporating principles of embodied cognition to\nground AI's understanding in interaction with the world.57 Pattern matching\nalone appears insufficient to replicate the depth and flexibility of human\nunderstanding. Therefore, a more holistic approach that incorporates\nreasoning, continuous learning, and a richer, more nuanced representation of\nthe world is likely to be necessary. Continued development and refinement of\nthese theoretical frameworks are essential for guiding future research in AI\nand for establishing a solid foundation upon which truly intelligent and\nunderstanding artificial systems can be built. A strong theoretical\nunderpinning will be crucial for addressing the fundamental challenges in\ncreating AI that can not only perform tasks but also comprehend the world and\nits own place within it in a meaningful way.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nResearch on emergent cognitive architectures in advanced AI is a rapidly\nevolving field with significant implications for the future of artificial\nintelligence. The phenomenon of emergent abilities in large language models,\nwhile demonstrating the power of scaling, continues to be debated regarding\nits fundamental nature and predictability. The quest for self-understanding in\nAI draws inspiration from human consciousness and explores various mechanisms\nsuch as embodiment, metacognition, and internal models, yet faces profound\nphilosophical and technical challenges. Principled reasoning, encompassing\nanalogical, abductive, counterfactual, moral, and causal forms, is crucial for\nbuilding reliable and trustworthy AI systems, but achieving human-level\nsophistication across these modalities remains an open challenge. Mechanistic\ninterpretability offers a promising approach to understanding the inner\nworkings of AI models, providing insights beyond black-box methods, although\nscalability and automation remain key hurdles. These research areas are deeply\nintertwined with the development of Artificial General Intelligence and the\ncritical need to ensure the safety and alignment of advanced AI systems with\nhuman values. The evaluation of cognitive capabilities in AI is an ongoing\nprocess, with the AI community continuously developing new and more\nchallenging benchmarks to overcome the limitations of existing ones and to\nbetter measure true understanding rather than just pattern matching. Finally,\nthe development of robust theoretical frameworks for artificial understanding,\ndrawing from diverse disciplines, is essential for guiding future research and\nbuilding AI systems that can comprehend the world in a meaningful and\ngeneralizable way. Continued in-depth research, multi-layered insights, and a\ndedicated effort to address the complex challenges outlined in this report\nwill be necessary to advance the field towards the development of\nsophisticated and beneficial advanced AI systems.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Different Types of AI Reasoning\n\nType of Reasoning| Definition| Key Characteristics| Potential Applications|\nKey Challenges  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nAnalogical| Solving new problems by drawing parallels to known scenarios.|\nTransfers knowledge based on structural similarities.| Problem-solving,\nlearning, knowledge transfer.| Requires flexible representation; LLMs may\nmimic rather than reason.  \nAbductive| Inferring the most plausible explanation for observations with\nincomplete information.| Focuses on likelihood and relevance; combines\nprobabilities and domain knowledge.| Medical diagnosis, fault detection,\nnatural language understanding.| Reliance on knowledge quality; difficult\nalgorithmic implementation.  \nCounterfactual| Reasoning about alternative past events to understand\ncausality.| Explores \"what if\" scenarios; identifies influential input\nvariables.| Model debugging, fairness analysis, regulatory compliance.|\nEnsuring realism and plausibility of scenarios.  \nMoral| Making ethical judgments based on moral principles.| Guided by\nprinciples (top-down) or learned from examples (bottom-up).| Ethical decision-\nmaking in autonomous systems.| Defining ethical principles; avoiding biases.  \nCausal| Understanding and modeling cause-and-effect relationships.| Goes\nbeyond correlation; uses causal graphs and interventions.| Product\ndevelopment, marketing, healthcare, finance.| Modeling complex real-world\ncausality.  \n  \nTable 2: Key Benchmarks for Evaluating AI Reasoning\n\nBenchmark Name| Focus Area| Key Characteristics/Tasks| Reported Performance of\nState-of-the-Art Models (Example)| Limitations  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nMMLU| Language Understanding| Covers 57 subjects; tests broad knowledge.|\nPhi-3-mini achieves >60%| May be becoming saturated.  \nGSM8K| Mathematical Reasoning| Grade-school math problems.| -| -  \nARC| Abstract Reasoning| Visual puzzles requiring pattern recognition and\ngeneralization.| -| Text-only models may be disadvantaged.  \nFrontierMath| Mathematical Reasoning| Expert-level, unpublished mathematics\nproblems.| AI systems solve only 2%| Very challenging.  \nHumanity's Last Exam| General Academic| Rigorous academic test across multiple\ndomains.| Top system scores just 8.80%| Very challenging.  \nBigCodeBench| Coding| Tests code generation and problem-solving.| AI systems\nachieve 35.5% (Human: 97%)| Significant gap between AI and human performance.  \nGameArena| Reasoning (Interactive)| Live computer games (Akinator, Taboo,\nBluffing) testing various reasoning types.| -| Relatively new; further\nresearch needed.  \nFLIP| Multimodal Reasoning| Ordering of 4 images to identify a logically\ncoherent sequence based on human verification.| Gemini 1.5 Pro: 77.9% (Human:\n95.3%)| Highlights limitations of current models.  \nTuring Applied AGI...| Real-World Knowledge Work| Tasks in software\nengineering, data science, math, and multimodal reasoning.| -| Focus on\npractical applications.  \nMathR-Eval| Mathematical Reasoning| 100 logical mathematics questions (not\nadvanced calculus).| o1 and o3-mini perform best.| Focus on logical reasoning.  \nPlanBench| Planning and Reasoning| Series of planning tasks testing step-by-\nstep plan generation for specific goals.| o1 shows high accuracy but high\ncost.| Efficiency, cost, and transparency are challenges.  \nGSM-Symbolic| Mathematical Reasoning| Builds on GSM8K with symbolic templates\nto test logical capabilities and robustness to irrelevant information.|\nSignificant performance drops with irrelevant info.| Suggests LLMs may mimic\nrather than reason logically.  \n  \n#### Works cited\n\n  1.
