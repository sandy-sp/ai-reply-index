Such an\nendeavor, while ambitious, holds the potential for significant advantages,\nincluding enhanced performance by eliminating the overhead associated with an\noperating system.1 Reduced latency, crucial for real-time applications\nleveraging LLMs, could also be achieved.3 Furthermore, by running only the\nnecessary code, power consumption might be lowered, which is particularly\nimportant for edge deployments.6 Finally, a minimized software stack could\nlead to enhanced security by reducing the attack surface.4\n\nHowever, realizing this vision entails navigating a complex landscape of\ntechnical hurdles. These include the intricate development of a bootloader\ncapable of loading and executing a large and sophisticated model, the\nnecessity for manual memory management and resource allocation typically\nhandled by an OS, the absence of readily available operating system services\nand abstractions, and the fundamental requirement of initializing the custom\nhardware and managing its peripherals directly.\n\nThe user's concept of a specialized system, devoid of a general-purpose\noperating system, allows for a high degree of tailoring of both hardware and\nsoftware specifically for the task of running the target LLM. This extreme\nspecialization offers a pathway to efficiency gains that might be unattainable\nwhen running an LLM on general-purpose hardware managed by a conventional\noperating system. The numerous services and drivers included in a typical OS,\nwhile providing flexibility for a wide range of applications, inevitably\nconsume computational resources and memory, introducing overhead that a\ndirect-boot system could potentially avoid.\n\nConversely, this intense focus on a single task comes with an inherent trade-\noff in flexibility. A system designed to boot directly into an LLM would be\ntightly coupled to that specific model and its requirements. Any deviation,\nwhether a change in the LLM itself or a desire to utilize the hardware for\nother computational tasks, would likely necessitate substantial re-engineering\nof the system. An operating system, by its nature, provides an abstraction\nlayer that allows diverse applications to run on the same underlying hardware.\nThe absence of this layer in a direct-boot scenario means that the hardware\nand the LLM are intrinsically linked.\n\n2\\. Understanding the Boot Process and Bare-Metal Execution\n\nThe standard boot sequence of a computer typically begins with the application\nof power, which triggers the initialization of the system's firmware, commonly\nknown as BIOS or UEFI.8 This firmware performs a power-on self-test (POST) to\ncheck the basic functionality of the hardware and initializes core components\nsuch as the CPU and memory.11 Following this initial phase, the firmware\nsearches for and loads a bootloader from a designated boot device, such as a\nhard drive or USB drive.11 The bootloader's primary role is then to load the\noperating system kernel into the system's memory and transfer control of the\nmachine to the kernel.11 Finally, the OS kernel takes over, initializing\nsystem services and eventually starting user-level applications.\n\nIn contrast to this OS-centric model, bare-metal programming involves the\ndirect execution of code on the hardware without the intermediary of an\noperating system.8 This paradigm necessitates direct interaction with the\nhardware's registers and peripherals, giving the programmer fine-grained\ncontrol over the system's behavior.16 Bare-metal environments typically\nfeature minimal or no abstraction layers, placing the responsibility for\nresource management and hardware interaction directly on the application\ndeveloper.4 This approach is commonly employed in embedded systems, real-time\napplications where precise timing is critical, and high-performance computing\nscenarios where specific tasks demand maximum efficiency.4 In a bare-metal\nsystem, the bootloader's role shifts to directly loading and executing the\ntarget application, which in the user's case would be the LLM.8\n\nAchieving the user's goal of booting directly into an LLM is indeed possible\nthrough the creation of a custom bootloader.11 This specialized bootloader\nwould need to initialize the hardware components essential for the LLM's\noperation and then directly load and start the LLM's pre-compiled executable\ncode.11 This requires the LLM to be compiled into a format that the bootloader\ncan directly load into memory and execute.11 Furthermore, the custom\nbootloader would need to handle fundamental tasks that are typically the\ndomain of an operating system, such as setting up memory regions for the LLM's\ncode and data, and potentially managing basic hardware interfaces that the LLM\nrelies upon.\n\nEven in a scenario where the intention is to bypass a full operating system,\nthe system's initial startup will invariably depend on the foundational\nfirmware present on the hardware, whether it is a traditional BIOS or the more\nmodern UEFI.8 Upon power-on, the CPU begins executing code from a designated\naddress within the firmware ROM. This initial firmware is responsible for the\nmost basic level of hardware initialization, such as setting up the CPU and\nessential chipsets. Therefore, a completely OS-less boot process still\nnecessitates this initial firmware stage to perform the very first steps of\nhardware enablement and to ultimately hand over control to the subsequent\nstage, which in this case would be the custom bootloader designed to load the\nLLM.\n\nThe feasibility of directly booting into an LLM is heavily contingent upon the\ncomplexity and the capabilities of the custom bootloader that would need to be\ndeveloped.15 A standard bootloader is primarily designed to locate and load an\noperating system, which then takes on the responsibility of managing\napplications. In contrast, for a direct-boot LLM, the bootloader effectively\nassumes the role of a highly minimal operating system, tasked with setting up\nthe specific runtime environment that the LLM requires to operate. This\nnecessitates a bootloader with capabilities far beyond those of a typical OS\nloader.\n\n3\\. Hardware Requirements for Large Language Models\n\nRunning large language models efficiently demands significant hardware\nresources. In terms of processing power, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have\nbecome the cornerstone for LLM workloads due to their inherent parallel\nprocessing capabilities, which align well with the matrix multiplications and\nother computations at the heart of deep learning.6 While GPUs handle the bulk\nof the model computations, a powerful Central Processing Unit (CPU) with a\nhigh core count remains essential for managing data pipelines, preprocessing\ntasks, and coordinating operations between different hardware components.41\nBeyond CPUs and GPUs, the field is seeing increasing interest in specialized\nAI accelerators like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Field-Programmable Gate\nArrays (FPGAs), and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which\nare being developed to further optimize LLM performance and energy\nefficiency.44\n\nMemory is another critical aspect. LLMs, with their billions of parameters,\nrequire substantial Video Random Access Memory (VRAM) to store these\nparameters for efficient inference and training.41 The specific amount of VRAM\nneeded is directly proportional to the size of the LLM, typically measured by\nthe number of its parameters.46 In addition to VRAM, ample system RAM is\nnecessary for handling the large datasets involved, for intermediate\ncomputations during LLM execution, and potentially for storing portions of the\nmodel if the VRAM capacity is a limitation.41 NVIDIA, a leading provider of\nGPUs for AI, recommends that the system have at least twice the amount of CPU\nsystem memory as the total GPU VRAM to accommodate efficient buffering.42\n\nFast storage solutions are also paramount for LLM workloads. High-speed NVMe\nSolid State Drives (SSDs) are crucial for rapidly loading the LLM model and\nthe associated datasets into memory.41 The overall storage requirements depend\non the size of the specific LLM being used and any additional data it might\nneed to access.42 Finally, for systems employing multiple GPUs to handle very\nlarge models, high-speed interconnects like NVLink become important to\nfacilitate efficient communication and memory sharing between the GPUs.41\n\nThe amount of available VRAM often acts as the primary bottleneck when working\nwith LLMs, effectively setting an upper limit on the size of the model that\ncan be handled without significant performance degradation.42 LLMs consist of\na vast number of parameters that the processing units need to access quickly\nfor computations. These parameters are typically stored in the high-bandwidth\nGPU memory for this very reason. If the size of the LLM exceeds the VRAM\ncapacity of the installed GPUs, the system will be forced to move data between\nthe slower system RAM and the VRAM, leading to a substantial drop in\nperformance.\n\nOngoing research into custom hardware solutions like FPGAs and ASICs for\naccelerating LLMs 6 is largely motivated by the need to overcome the\nlimitations of general-purpose GPUs, particularly in terms of energy\nefficiency and potentially latency. These factors could be especially critical\nfor a direct-boot system designed to run a specific LLM. While GPUs offer\nconsiderable parallel processing power, they are designed to be versatile and\nmight not be perfectly optimized for the specific computational patterns found\nin all LLM architectures. Custom hardware allows for the creation of\narchitectures that are precisely tailored to the unique computational demands\nof LLMs, potentially resulting in better performance per watt and lower\noverall latency.\n\n4\\. Exploring Custom Hardware Solutions for LLM Acceleration\n\nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) represent a class of reconfigurable\nhardware that can be customized to accelerate specific computational\nworkloads, including those associated with large language models.6 FPGAs offer\na significant degree of flexibility, allowing developers to design and\nimplement custom hardware architectures that can be optimized for low latency\nand high energy efficiency.6 Research in this area has demonstrated the\npotential for FPGAs to achieve substantial speedups and energy efficiency\nimprovements compared to traditional GPUs for certain LLM tasks.6 Notably,\nresearchers have reported achieving 50 times greater efficiency than GPUs by\nrunning a billion-parameter LLM on custom hardware based on an FPGA, with a\npower consumption of only 13 watts.6 This achievement involved eliminating the\ncomputationally intensive matrix multiplication operations typically used in\nneural networks and leveraging a custom hardware prototype built on an FPGA to\nfully exploit energy-saving features programmed into their neural network. The\nresulting system was able to process text at a rate faster than human reading\nspeed while operating on a remarkably low power budget.\n\nApplication-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) take the concept of custom\nhardware a step further by being designed and fabricated specifically for a\nparticular application or set of applications, offering the potential for\nmaximum performance and energy efficiency.44 ASICs can be highly optimized for\nthe specific computational demands of LLMs, allowing for significant gains in\nspeed and power consumption.47 A prominent example in the field of AI is\nGoogle's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which was developed specifically to\naccelerate deep learning workloads.44 Early research into the use of ASICs for\ntransformer networks, the underlying architecture of many modern LLMs, has\nshown promising results, with significant speedups and energy efficiency\nimprovements compared to both CPUs and GPUs.47 For instance, the A3 ASIC\ndemonstrated up to a 7x speedup and an 11x improvement in energy efficiency\ncompared to an Intel Gold 6128 CPU for attention mechanism computations.47\nAnother ASIC, ELSA, achieved even more impressive results, showing up to a\n157x speedup over GPUs for the self-attention computation within transformer\nnetworks.47\n\nNeuromorphic computing represents an alternative computing paradigm that draws\ninspiration from the structure and function of the human brain.76 This\napproach typically utilizes spiking neural networks and event-driven\nprocessing, which hold the potential for ultra-low power consumption,\nmimicking the energy efficiency of biological systems.76 Early research in\nthis area has indicated the promise of neuromorphic hardware for efficient LLM\ninference.76 For example, researchers working with Intel's Loihi 2\nneuromorphic processor presented a novel MatMul-free LLM architecture that, in\npreliminary findings, demonstrated up to a 3x higher throughput and a 2x\nreduction in energy consumption compared to transformer-based LLMs running on\nan edge GPU.76 Despite these promising results, neuromorphic computing remains\nlargely in the research and development phase and has not yet seen widespread\nadoption in practical applications.77\n\nFPGAs offer a compelling middle ground between the versatility of software-\nbased solutions running on general-purpose processors and the ultimate\nefficiency of custom-designed ASICs.6 They provide a means to implement custom\nhardware architectures with a more manageable timeframe and lower initial\ncosts compared to the significant investment required for ASIC design and\nfabrication. This makes FPGAs a potentially valuable platform for prototyping\nand validating the concept of a direct-boot LLM system before committing to a\nmore specialized ASIC implementation.\n\nA significant driving force behind the exploration of custom hardware,\nparticularly FPGAs and neuromorphic chips, for LLMs is the imperative to\naddress the substantial energy consumption associated with training and\noperating these large models.6 The operational costs and environmental impact\nof LLMs are considerable, making energy efficiency a critical concern. Custom\nhardware solutions are being actively investigated as a way to dramatically\nreduce the power requirements for running LLMs, which would be a significant\nadvantage for a dedicated, direct-boot LLM device, especially for deployments\nat the edge where power resources might be constrained.\n\nAccelerator Type| Key Characteristics| Pros| Cons| Examples  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nGPU| Parallel processing, high throughput| Widely available, mature software\necosystem| Can be power-hungry, not always optimal for specific LLM\noperations| NVIDIA RTX/A/H series, AMD Radeon Pro  \nTPU| Custom ASIC optimized for deep learning (TensorFlow)| High performance\nfor TensorFlow workloads, energy efficient| Primarily for Google Cloud, less\ngeneral-purpose| Google TPUs  \nFPGA| Reconfigurable hardware| Flexible, can be optimized for low latency and\nenergy efficiency| More complex programming than GPUs, lower peak performance|\nXilinx Alveo, Intel Arria/Stratix, Achronix Speedster  \nASIC| Custom-designed chip for specific applications| Maximum performance and\nenergy efficiency for targeted workloads| High development cost and time, less\nflexible| Google TPUs, custom accelerators (A3, ELSA)  \nNeuromorphic| Brain-inspired, spiking neural networks, event-driven| Potential\nfor ultra-low power consumption, biologically plausible| Still in research\nphase, limited availability and software support| Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth,\nAkida NSoC  \n  \n5\\. The Feasibility of a Direct-Boot LLM System\n\nThe linchpin of a direct-boot LLM system on custom hardware would be a highly\nspecialized bootloader. This bootloader would need to perform a minimal set of\nhardware initializations, focusing only on the components that the LLM\nrequires to operate. For ARM Cortex processors, this includes essential steps\nlike configuring the clock system, initializing the memory controller and RAM,\nand setting the vector table and stack pointers before transferring control to\nthe application.23 The bootloader's core function would then be to load the\npre-compiled LLM directly from a non-volatile storage medium, such as flash\nmemory or an external memory interface like QSPI, into the appropriate memory\nlocations.23 This process would necessitate a deep understanding of the\nsystem's memory layout and the specific format in which the LLM has been\ncompiled.\n\nBeyond loading, the bootloader might also need to set up specific memory\nregions required by the LLM for its parameters, activations, and working\nmemory. It could also be responsible for initializing basic peripherals that\nthe LLM might need for input or output, such as configuring GPIO pins or\nsetting up communication interfaces like UART or Ethernet.23 Finally, the\nbootloader would transfer the execution flow to the LLM's designated entry\npoint in memory.23 This often involves disabling any interrupts that were\nactive during the boot process and setting the program counter to the starting\naddress of the LLM's code.25\n\nDesigning such a bootloader involves several critical considerations. The\ninitial boot stage might have severe size constraints, as exemplified by the\nMaster Boot Record (MBR) on x86 systems, which is limited to 512 bytes.11 This\nmight necessitate a multi-stage bootloader approach, where a small initial\nbootloader loads a more capable second-stage bootloader from storage.11 The\nbootloader must also be designed to interface with the specific non-volatile\nstorage medium where the LLM is stored, which could be internal flash memory\nor external devices.90 Furthermore, for a practical system, the bootloader\nshould ideally include mechanisms for updating the LLM firmware, allowing for\nbug fixes, performance enhancements, or even the deployment of newer LLM\nversions.23 Techniques like A/B partitioning, where two copies of the firmware\nare stored, can improve the robustness of the update process.37 Finally,\nsecurity is a crucial aspect, and the bootloader should incorporate measures\nto prevent unauthorized modifications to the LLM, such as cryptographic\nsignatures to verify the integrity of the firmware before loading and\nexecution.24\n\nTo run directly on bare metal, the LLM itself, typically developed using high-\nlevel frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, would need to be adapted or a\nspecific model chosen that can be compiled into a self-contained executable.41\nThis process might involve using specialized tools or libraries designed for\nembedded machine learning, such as TinyML, or developing a custom compilation\nflow to generate code that can run without the extensive runtime dependencies\nof a full OS. Standard LLM frameworks rely heavily on OS-level functionalities\nfor tasks like memory management and file system access, so these dependencies\nwould need to be carefully addressed. Furthermore, meticulous planning of the\nmemory layout and addressing scheme within the bare-metal environment is\nessential. Linker scripts would play a vital role in ensuring that different\nsections of the LLM's code and data are placed in the correct memory regions\naccessible by the bootloader and the LLM during execution.25\n\nEven in the absence of a complete operating system, a minimal Hardware\nAbstraction Layer (HAL) might prove necessary to provide a consistent\ninterface for the LLM to interact with the custom hardware.41 This HAL would\nessentially be a set of custom-developed drivers for the various hardware\ncomponents present in the system. It could include routines for accessing\nmemory, controlling communication interfaces like UART or Ethernet, and\ninteracting with any other peripherals that the LLM requires for its\noperation, such as sensors for input or actuators for output.\n\nThe custom bootloader in this scenario transcends the role of a mere OS\nloader; it effectively becomes a highly specialized, minimal runtime\nenvironment tailored to the specific needs of the LLM.23 It takes on\nresponsibilities that typically fall under the purview of an operating system,\nsuch as hardware initialization, loading a complex application, setting up its\nmemory space, and potentially providing rudimentary services through a HAL.\nThis blurring of the lines between a traditional bootloader and a very basic,\nsingle-application OS highlights the complexity involved in such a direct-boot\nsystem.\n\nA significant challenge lies in the compatibility of existing LLM frameworks\nwith a bare-metal environment.41 These frameworks are generally designed to\noperate on top of an OS, which offers a rich set of abstractions and services\nthat simplify application development. Adapting an LLM, developed using such a\nframework, to run directly on bare metal without these underlying OS\nfunctionalities would likely require a substantial engineering effort. It\nmight not even be feasible for all frameworks or LLM model architectures.\nOvercoming this hurdle might necessitate the use of specialized, lightweight\nLLM inference libraries that are specifically designed for deployment in\nresource-constrained embedded systems, or a significant re-architecting of the\nLLM's dependencies.\n\n6\\. Memory Management and Resource Allocation in a Bare-Metal LLM\n\nIn a bare-metal LLM system, the absence of an operating system means there is\nno built-in virtual memory, paging mechanisms, or dynamic memory allocation\ntypically provided by an OS.8 Consequently, memory management becomes the sole\nresponsibility of the bootloader and the LLM software itself.17 The memory\nlayout of the system, including the allocation of memory regions for the LLM's\ncode, its extensive parameter data, the runtime stack, and any necessary\nbuffers, must be meticulously defined and managed explicitly.17 This requires\na thorough understanding of the memory architecture of the custom hardware and\nthe specific memory usage patterns of the target LLM.\n\nThe most likely approach to memory management in such a system would involve\nstatic allocation, where memory regions are pre-allocated either at compile\ntime or during the initialization phase of the bootloader.27 This method\nsimplifies memory management but necessitates knowing the precise memory\nrequirements of the LLM model in advance.46 This might involve a detailed\nanalysis of the LLM's architecture and its memory footprint based on the\nnumber of parameters and the precision used to represent them.\n\nHandling very large LLMs in a bare-metal environment presents significant\nchallenges, particularly when the custom hardware has limited memory\nresources.42 In such cases, techniques like model parallelism, where the\nmodel's computations are distributed across multiple processing units, or\noffloading parts of the model to slower but larger memory might need to be\nconsidered. A crucial optimization for running LLMs on resource-constrained\nhardware is quantization, which involves reducing the precision of the model's\nweights and activations, thereby significantly decreasing its memory\nfootprint.66 Unlike systems with operating systems that can attempt dynamic\nmemory allocation, bare-metal systems typically avoid this due to the\npotential for memory fragmentation.94 Therefore, static allocation, while\nrequiring careful upfront planning, is generally the preferred and more stable\napproach.\n\nFinally, the bootloader might also need to handle the allocation of specific\nhardware resources required for the LLM's execution. For instance, if the\ncustom hardware includes a dedicated AI accelerator like an FPGA or ASIC, the\nbootloader would need to initialize and configure this accelerator, making its\nprocessing cores and memory accessible to the LLM's execution flow.\n\nIn a bare-metal LLM system, the responsibility for managing the system's\nmemory rests entirely with the developer. Without the memory management and\nprotection mechanisms offered by an operating system, any errors in memory\nallocation or management can lead to critical system failures or unpredictable\nbehavior.17 Therefore, a deep understanding of the hardware's memory\narchitecture and the LLM's specific memory needs is paramount. Careful\nplanning, potentially involving the creation of detailed memory maps defined\nin linker scripts, along with the implementation of custom memory management\nroutines, will be essential to prevent memory corruption and ensure the\noverall stability of the system.\n\nGiven the potentially immense memory requirements of LLMs, especially for\nlarger models with billions of parameters, the application of quantization\ntechniques will likely be a key enabler for making a direct-boot system\nfeasible on custom hardware with limited memory resources.66 By reducing the\nnumber of bits used to represent the model's weights and activations,\nquantization can significantly decrease the overall memory footprint of the\nLLM. This reduction is crucial for allowing larger models to potentially fit\nwithin the constraints of smaller memory capacities, which is often the case\nin embedded or custom hardware designs compared to the more abundant resources\navailable in server-grade environments.\n\n7\\. Firmware Initialization and Hardware Enablement for a Custom LLM System\n\nThe journey to booting a custom AI hardware system directly into an LLM begins\nwith the crucial step of firmware initialization. The custom bootloader, or\npotentially a very early stage firmware component, needs to perform the\ninitial setup of the essential hardware components.23 This includes bringing\nup the CPU core(s) and configuring their basic registers to a known and\noperational state. The memory controller must be initialized to enable access\nto the system's RAM, and the clock system and power management units need to\nbe configured to ensure the correct operating frequencies and power modes for\noptimal performance and efficiency.23 These low-level initialization tasks\noften involve direct manipulation of hardware registers, requiring a thorough\nunderstanding of the specific hardware architecture and its register map,\ntypically found in the device's technical documentation.16\n\nIf the custom hardware incorporates a dedicated AI accelerator, such as an\nFPGA or an ASIC, the bootloader must also handle its initialization and\nconfiguration.6 For FPGAs, this might involve loading a specific configuration\nbitstream that defines the custom hardware architecture. In the case of ASICs,\nit could entail loading specific firmware or configuration data required for\nthe accelerator to function correctly. For example, Habana Gaudi AI\naccelerators necessitate the loading of specific firmware during the\ninitialization process.96\n\nFurthermore, the bootloader needs to initialize any peripherals that the LLM\nwill rely upon for its operation.17 This could include setting up\ncommunication interfaces like UART for serial communication with external\ndevices or network interfaces like Ethernet for network-based input or output.\nThe specific peripherals that need initialization will depend on the intended\napplication and how the LLM will interact with the outside world.\n\nDeveloping the firmware and bootloader for such a custom system typically\ninvolves the use of low-level programming languages like C or assembly.16\nThese languages provide the necessary level of control over the hardware to\nperform the intricate initialization steps. The development process also\nrequires the use of specialized Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and\ntoolchains that are specific to the target hardware platform.17 For instance,\nKeil MDK-ARM is a popular IDE for developing firmware for ARM-based\nmicrocontrollers.17\n\nDeveloping the firmware and bootloader for a custom AI hardware system demands\na profound understanding of the underlying hardware architecture. This\nincludes not only the CPU and memory subsystems but also any specialized AI\naccelerators that are part of the design.10 Without the abstraction provided\nby an operating system, developers must have a detailed knowledge of how each\nhardware component functions and how to configure it at a very low level. This\noften involves in-depth study of hardware manuals and datasheets to understand\nthe register map and the sequence of operations required for proper\ninitialization. Tools such as hardware debuggers and emulators 17 become\nindispensable for tracing the execution of the firmware and identifying and\nresolving any initialization issues.\n\nFor the long-term viability of a direct-boot LLM system, the ability to\nperform firmware updates is crucial.23 This includes the need to update the\nLLM model itself to incorporate bug fixes, performance improvements, or even\nentirely new model versions. The bootloader must be designed to include\nmechanisms for receiving and installing these updates, which might involve\nover-the-air (OTA) update capabilities if the hardware has network\nconnectivity 24, or the ability to update from an external storage medium.\nImplementing robust update mechanisms, potentially including features like\ndual boot partitions to allow for rollback in case of a failed update 37, and\nsecure boot to verify the integrity of the new firmware 24, will be essential\nto ensure the system remains functional and up-to-date over its lifespan.\n\n8\\. Trade-offs, Challenges, and Considerations\n\nEmbarking on the development of a custom hardware system that boots directly\ninto an LLM without an operating system presents a unique set of trade-offs.\nOn the positive side, such a system offers the potential for superior\nperformance and lower latency compared to systems running a general-purpose\nOS, as the bare-metal approach eliminates the overhead associated with\nvirtualization and background processes.1 Optimized resource utilization and\npotentially lower power consumption can also be achieved by running only the\ncode strictly necessary for the LLM.6 Furthermore, the absence of a full OS\ncan lead to a reduced complexity and a smaller attack surface, enhancing the\nsystem's security.4 Finally, developers gain greater control over both the\nhardware and software, allowing for fine-grained optimizations tailored to the\nspecific LLM workload.4\n\nHowever, these advantages come with significant challenges. The development\ncomplexity is considerably higher compared to building applications on top of\nan existing operating system, as developers are responsible for managing\neverything from low-level hardware initialization to memory allocation.17 This\nnecessitates a steeper learning curve and requires expertise in both bare-\nmetal programming and the intricacies of the target hardware architecture,\nskill sets that might not be readily available.17 The lack of operating system\nservices, such as file system access, networking stacks, and device drivers,\nmeans that these functionalities would need to be implemented from scratch if\nthe LLM requires them 8, a time-consuming and complex undertaking.108\nDebugging in a bare-metal environment can also be more challenging due to the\nabsence of OS-level debugging tools and error logs, potentially requiring\ncustom debugging setups.8 Furthermore, the software ecosystem and the\navailability of pre-built libraries are significantly more limited compared to\nOS-based development, potentially leading to lower code reusability.19\nPortability of the LLM and the bootloader to different hardware platforms can\nalso be a major challenge, as bare-metal code is typically tightly coupled to\nthe specific hardware architecture.19 Finally, achieving scalability in terms\nof managing resources and handling multiple concurrent tasks might be more\nlimited compared to OS-based systems that can dynamically allocate and manage\nresources.8\n\nSeveral important considerations need to be taken into account when evaluating\nthe feasibility of such a project. The specific LLM model that the user\nintends to run is a primary factor, as its size and computational requirements\nwill dictate the necessary hardware resources.46 The intended use case and the\ndesired performance goals, such as acceptable latency, required throughput,\nand power consumption limits, will also heavily influence the design\ndecisions.3 The availability of resources and expertise within the development\nteam for tackling the complexities of bare-metal programming and hardware\narchitecture is another critical factor.17 Finally, the potential need for\nfuture updates and modifications to the LLM model necessitates careful\nplanning for a robust update mechanism on the bare-metal system.23\n\nCreating a custom direct-boot LLM system represents a substantial engineering\nundertaking that demands specialized skills and a significant commitment of\ntime and resources.17 Unlike developing applications within the familiar\nenvironment of an operating system, this approach requires building much of\nthe foundational software infrastructure from the ground up, including the\nbootloader, potentially a minimal HAL, and ensuring the chosen LLM can be\nadapted to run within this constrained environment. This necessitates a deep\nand comprehensive understanding of both the target hardware and the principles\nof low-level software development.\n\nWhile the potential performance advantages of a direct-boot system are\ncompelling, particularly in scenarios where even small amounts of latency or\nOS-induced overhead are unacceptable, these benefits must be carefully weighed\nagainst the considerably increased complexity and overall effort associated\nwith the development and ongoing maintenance of such a system compared to\nutilizing a standard operating system.1 For highly specific and performance-\ncritical applications, the gains in efficiency and control might indeed\njustify the increased development burden. However, for more general use cases\nor in situations where rapid development cycles and inherent flexibility are\nimportant considerations, leveraging the well-established abstractions and\nservices provided by a standard operating system might ultimately prove to be\na more practical and cost-effective strategy.\n\n9\\. Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nIn conclusion, the creation of custom hardware that boots directly into\nrunning a large language model without an operating system is technically\nfeasible, particularly with the advancements in custom hardware solutions like\nFPGAs, as demonstrated by research achieving highly efficient LLM execution on\nsuch platforms.6 However, realizing this concept presents significant\nengineering challenges that necessitate expertise in bare-metal programming,\nhardware architecture, and a deep understanding of the target LLM's\nrequirements.\n\nThe potential benefits of such a system, including enhanced performance,\nimproved energy efficiency, and a reduced security footprint, are compelling.\nNevertheless, the hurdles to overcome are substantial, primarily involving the\ncomplex development of a specialized bootloader and firmware, the intricate\nmanagement of memory and hardware resources in the absence of an OS, and the\nneed to address the lack of readily available OS services and software\necosystems.\n\nLooking towards the future, several trends could make this endeavor more\naccessible. Continued research into specialized hardware architectures\noptimized for LLM inference, as highlighted in surveys of hardware\naccelerators 47, is likely to yield more energy-efficient and performant\nsolutions. The development of lightweight LLM frameworks or model formats\nspecifically designed for bare-metal deployment could also lower the barrier\nto entry. Furthermore, advancements in bootloader technology might lead to\nmore sophisticated solutions capable of handling the loading and\ninitialization of complex applications like LLMs with greater ease.\n\nUltimately, while the user's query represents an ambitious undertaking, it\nalso points to a potentially fruitful direction for exploring the boundaries\nof LLM deployment, especially in the realm of highly specialized edge AI\napplications where performance, efficiency, and control are of paramount\nimportance.\n\n#### Works cited\n\n  1.
