# Prompt

**Architecting Verifiably Aligned and Safe Artificial General Intelligence
(AGI)**

- **Focus Area:** AGI Safety and Alignment
- **Prompt Details:** "Conduct a comprehensive research analysis on the architectural and theoretical frameworks necessary to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that is verifiably aligned with human values and demonstrably safe. This investigation should explore:
  - **Core Alignment Strategies:** Critically evaluate current leading alignment proposals (e.g., scalable oversight, debate, recursive reward modeling, value learning, constitutional AI) for their potential efficacy and limitations as intelligence scales towards AGI.
  - **Formal Verification & Safety Guarantees:** Investigate methods from formal verification, program synthesis, and robust statistics that could be adapted or newly developed to provide mathematical or near-mathematical guarantees about AGI behavior, particularly in novel situations or under adversarial conditions.
  - **Interpretability and "Black Box" Problem at AGI Scale:** Propose novel techniques or extensions of existing interpretability methods (e.g., mechanistic interpretability, causal tracing) that could remain effective for understanding and debugging systems with super-human cognitive capabilities.
  - **Governance and Control Mechanisms:** Explore robust and adaptable governance structures and control mechanisms for AGI development and deployment, considering scenarios of rapid capability gains, potential for self-modification, and multi-agent AGI systems.
  - **Catastrophic Risk Analysis & Mitigation:** Identify and categorize potential catastrophic failure modes specific to AGI (e.g., instrumental convergence on undesirable goals, unintended side-effects at scale, coordinated malicious use) and propose research directions for proactive mitigation strategies.
  - **The Role of Simulated Environments:** How can complex, high-fidelity simulated environments be used to rigorously test AGI alignment and safety across a vast range of scenarios before real-world deployment?"
- **Keywords for further research:** AGI safety, AI alignment, formal verification AI, interpretable AGI, AI governance, catastrophic AI risks, value learning AI.
