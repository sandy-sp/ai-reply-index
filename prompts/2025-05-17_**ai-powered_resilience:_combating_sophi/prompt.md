**AI-Powered Resilience: Combating Sophisticated, Coordinated, and Adversarial
Multi-Modal Disinformation Campaigns**

- **Focus Area:** AI Ethics, Misinformation/Disinformation, AI Security, Media Forensics
- **Prompt Details:** "Conduct an in-depth research investigation into the development of a resilient, multi-layered, AI-driven defense framework against sophisticated, coordinated, and adversarially evolving multi-modal disinformation campaigns (involving text, images, audio, video, and deepfakes). This research should explore:
  - **Early Detection of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior:** AI techniques for identifying patterns of coordinated activity across multiple platforms and media types that indicate an orchestrated disinformation campaign, even before specific pieces of false content gain significant traction.
  - **Robust Multi-Modal Content Authenticity Verification:** Advancing AI-powered forensic tools for detecting subtle manipulations in various media formats, including methods resilient to common adversarial attacks (e.g., GAN-generated content specifically designed to fool detectors).
  - **Attribution and Source Tracing of Disinformation:** Research into AI methodologies that can assist in tracing disinformation back to its origins or primary disseminators, considering both technical artifacts and behavioral patterns.
  - **Understanding and Predicting Disinformation Impact:** AI models to predict the potential reach, impact, and psychological effect of specific disinformation narratives on different populations, and to identify communities most vulnerable to such campaigns.
  - **AI-Augmented Counter-Messaging and Inoculation Strategies:** Exploring the ethical development and application of AI to help generate and disseminate effective, fact-based counter-narratives, or to design "inoculation" strategies that can build cognitive resilience against common disinformation techniques.
  - **The Human-AI Partnership in Combating Disinformation:** How can AI tools best augment the capabilities of human fact-checkers, journalists, educators, and policymakers in the fight against disinformation, ensuring human oversight and ethical application?"
- **Keywords for further research:** AI disinformation detection, multi-modal deepfake analysis, coordinated inauthentic behavior AI, AI media forensics, adversarial attacks on AI detectors, AI counter-disinformation.
