clinical symptoms even arise.2 Artificial intelligence, with its advanced
methodologies in predictive analytics, is proving to be exceptionally well-
suited for this task.4 Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), key
subsets of AI, employ sophisticated algorithms that can sift through enormous
volumes of patient data, identifying intricate patterns and subtle trends that
traditional analytical methods might easily overlook.4 This capability to
extract meaningful insights from complex datasets is fundamental to enabling
early interventions and personalized care plans.

The power of AI in risk prediction is further amplified when it can leverage
multimodal data, integrating information from a variety of sources to create a
more comprehensive understanding of an individual's health.5 Electronic Health
Records (EHRs), containing a wealth of longitudinal patient information, can
be combined with genomic data, providing insights into genetic predispositions
to disease. Wearable devices, continuously monitoring physiological parameters
and lifestyle factors, offer real-time health metrics. Medical imaging, such
as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, provides crucial structural and functional
information. By processing these diverse data streams simultaneously, AI can
construct a clearer and more complete picture of a patient's overall health,
leading to more accurate and nuanced risk assessments.5

AI is already demonstrating remarkable capabilities in the early detection of
a wide range of diseases. In the realm of cancer, AI algorithms are being
